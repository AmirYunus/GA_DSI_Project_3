my mother and i have had a really,,,,difficult relationship regarding my social media. i’ve fought with her for years, because she uses it as a method to get “gossip” on my friends and report back to me what she learned. she also critiques who i follow, and looks through my messages on my dms. she uses my instagram account, logged in as me, and i can’t take it anymore. 

i told her today that the day i turn 18 that she needs to log off my social media and just simply follow me instead because i’ll be a legal adult and legal adults don’t have their parents stalking their every footstep online. after i told her this she told me that will not happen as long as i live under her roof. she then tells me that this is normal and that every parent does this to their kid.

she tells me that the reason she does this is because i did “questionable” stuff, even though i haven’t. i’ve never drank, done drugs, anything. i sit in my room and make bracelets and play nintendo games. i feel like i’m talking to a brick wall because if i even bring up the fact that i’ll be an adult soon she tells me to stop being rude or else she’ll take my phone.

 So I have been dating my partner for two years and after some serious thinking and needed opportunity we decided to move in together last July. It's been awesome and I love them dearly. I'm happy they're around. They maintain their own finances, we take care of the apt together. But a problem that has been looming over the horizon is now quickly approaching, and it's got me so distracted from school and work that I really have no clue what to do.

I am unfortunately sort of financially dependant on my parents. I pay my own bills but theyve been around to help me through emergencies and medical bills when I was in dire straights, and I'm very grateful for it. Every year my parents buy me a ticket home for the holidays, usually 2 weeks, a very generous gift on account of my personal funds being super limited. So of course mom is now asking for when I can come home. My problem is that I am NOT out to my family except my brother. Maybe they have some sort of clue, I dont know, but they assume I'm striaght and they have NO idea that I'm dating my ""roommate"".

I am thousands of miles from home. If I gl down there, I will be all alone; my brother lives closer to me than them. The way I see it my current options are:

1. Call and come out now, before anything gets purchased. My 5 years senior brother says this is the worst option, that they need to hear it from me face to face. But I've almost picked up the phone to do so every day. If theyre going to hate me, I shouldnt hold out any longer.

2. Try to purchase a plane ticket myself... Somehow..., show up, and come out, and either a) show up with my partner and try to find SOME way to afford us both going, come out with my partner their physically which could be very awkward for them and my parents, (my brother says just showing up with partner is ALSO a bad idea, but that doesnt feel fair to partner) or b) leave my partner alone for at least a week over our first christmas together, which would break their heart for sure. It also opens up the conversation of ""well why are you buying it yourself???"" When I call my mom.

3. Let parents purchase ticket, which guarantees me going, but show up without my partner and come out then while theyre all alone back in my apartment

4. Lie and say I can't come due to school. Stay with partner. Miss out on family. Really, really break my moms heart. Family is everything to her and with my brother not calling or going home hardly ever, I'm the only bit that she's been counting on.

There may be some options Im not realizing or remembering. The thing is I have a pretty close relationship with my family, but they're very conservative, enough to the point that I don't know WHAT their reaction would be. My dad has a horrible temper and I dont want to disappoint my mom. I'm scared, honestly. I don't want to lose them, but I feel like I'm hiding and lying and the guilt is crushing me. 

Parents of Reddit, what would you want your kid to do if they were in this situation? How does a parent see this situation? Have I already screwed up? Any advice is helpful...

EDIT: Thank you all so much for your advice. I was so wrapped up in the stress of coming out that I forgot parents are weird about new partners being brought home in general. I'm going to get some more answers, but at least now I have some suggestions about how to approach this without feeling like Im so spiralling out of control. Thanks!

ADDITION: I should mention: one of my cousins, older, male, came out as gay at a christmas get together and brought his husband home, married without telling anyone. My whole fam is southern, it was very like.... Idk if youve experienced a room of people being polite but also uncomfortable and judgemental in just their aura. My mom hardly talked to cuz but does mention his husband when she hears something about them. I never saw my dad even look at cuz or speak to him, and he was dismissive and grumpy the whole day, and also we all were only with extended family for a day. But, he also is not on the best terms with his siblings and my brother has said repeatedly ""its sure to be different when its [my dads] kids"". Which is not really a clear yes or no. My point is, even in having a direct example I don't have a clear answer and I really have NO way of guessing what their actions would be. :(","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys,&lt;/p&gt;

I think she's in denial because her ex husbands family was brutally honest and told her straight up that it's her fault for doing this to him because she was smoking cigarettes through the whole pregnancy.

this is the first baby in our family and knowing my parents i know that she'll get showered in gifts for the baby, she already has... and i just want to get her something that's only for her, that she can enjoy in peace and quiet.

was there anything that you REALLY wanted or needed that was just for you during this time?

only thing i can think of now is some kind of spa treatment or something but she absolutely hates massages (don't understand but okay)..

My son is generally responsible, but sometimes has been deceptive in the past (like all kids he tries to get away with some stuff).  I generally trust him though and he has shown himself to be responsible.

He is, however, sometimes careless and loses things often. He lacks ""situational awareness"".  He has had multiple electronic devices stolen from him or misplaced and lost over the years, at school or while out and about, including a laptop he saved up for himself.

I'm considering telling him we need to have a tracker id tag on his keys, or possibly in the car itself.  I don't know now if he will think that's a good idea or feel like I don't trust him.

So I'm mostly just curious what other parents do?  Do you track your kids mobility once they start driving?  Only if you have reason to doubt them?

&lt;p&gt;He is, however, sometimes careless and loses things often. He lacks &amp;quot;situational awareness&amp;quot;.  He has had multiple electronic devices stolen from him or misplaced and lost over the years, at school or while out and about, including a laptop he saved up for himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m considering telling him we need to have a tracker id tag on his keys, or possibly in the car itself.  I don&amp;#39;t know now if he will think that&amp;#39;s a good idea or feel like I don&amp;#39;t trust him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m mostly just curious what other parents do?  Do you track your kids mobility once they start driving?  Only if you have reason to doubt them?  What if it&amp;#39;s their car, versus your own that you let them drive?  Is there any conversational land mines I should watch out for?&lt;/p&gt;

I am mainly looking for any advice/support on how to deal with the issue and if there is anything that can be done.

My \[20F\] brother \[17M\] is currently a high-school junior and for about a year now, he has been struggling to wake up on time for school and that is resulting in him missing entire periods and failing courses. I am currently in college and do not live at home so I am having a lot of trouble managing him and helping him build better habits. The only other guardian we have is our mother and she works really long hours from (9 am to 11 pm) so she will also often fail to wake him up. Sometimes, she will ""wake"" him up and go back to sleep herself and then he will also fall back asleep. Since my older sister and I have gotten into college, my mom has sort of stopped supervising the rest of her kids and now it is really on me to discipline/teach them. We bought him a really powerful alarm (the one with the bed shaker attached too) and he loves to ""wake"" up to it, turn it off, and climb back into bed. He has never been the best student because he hates doing schoolwork, but now he is just outright failing because he cannot wake up on time. Currently, he has trigonometry first period and has missed nearly half his classes.

I text him every day and asks if he has gone to school on time and thankfully he is honest about it. I also try to call him every night to remind him to go to school on time the next day. I do not think the issue is lack of sleep as even if he got 6 hours, he would fail to wake up. I have seen him sleep 14 hours on the weekends. I am really unsure of how to proceed now because I can only do so much virtually. He definitely does feel bad about being late and missing class but he struggles so much with waking up on time. I know he has an afterschool job that he enjoys and I have recently made a threat that if he doesn't wake up for school on time then he is going to have to quit because he can't seem to manage schoolwork with his part-time job. However, I know it probably won't work.

Is there anything that I can do to help him? Is this problem a teenager thing (when I was in HS I also was chronically late but by only 1-2 minutes and never by whole classes)? My classes in college require me to wake up around 8:00 am somedays and 11:00 am the others. He has told me that he has to be out of the house by 7:30 am in order to make it to school on time. Would it be a good idea if I set an alarm at 7:00 and call him repeatedly and my mom too?

I still mentioned babies but things like “when we have our kids they are going to be so cute!” Or “I think we’ll have a boy first” to which he’ll say “I want a boy but my uncles and dad all had girls first so we most likely will have a girl first”. Simple things like that.

Anyway, just 2 days ago my husband said he wanted to start having a family, he said he thinks it will bring us even closer. Also I’m a stay at home wife, I’m unable to work because I was brought here as a young child and don’t have residency. We’re currently in the process with our immigration attorney of getting my visa. He says that having a baby will also be nice because I’ll be able to stay home with him/her. 

Here is my dilemma. I’ve always thought the only thing I was waiting for was my husband to say “I’m ready!” Then I would take out my birth control and we would start trying. But that’s not really how it’s worked out. I kind of feel something like wedding jitters but I don’t know if its jitters or cold feet? I’m not sure. 

We are living with my parents now, didn’t workout with the in-laws unfortunately but our relationship with them is fine. We will be done fixing a mother-in-law house on my parents property next week and then we move in. So we’ll have space for baby. 

Now here is the thing, he has a good job but we obviously can’t afford to buy our own house since I am not able to work. Since he has been the only one working he’s unable to continue his education and I’m unable to continue mine as well(high school graduates only for now)He makes enough money and all my parents ask us to pay is the water bill ($120~180 every other month) we will be pitching in to the electricity bill once we settle in to the mother in law house though to lighten the load. 

My husband wants a July baby, his birthday is in July and he wants to share that birthday with our baby. That means we have to conceive this month. 

What I’m looking for here is for you men and women to tell me how you feel before you started trying? What phase in life were you in? Any advice you could give?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My husband and I have been married a little over a year, I’ve always wanted children he on the other hand said he wasn’t ready yet which I 100% understood. I still mentioned babies but things like “when we have our kids they are going to be so cute!” Or “I think we’ll have a boy first” to which he’ll say “I want a boy but my uncles and dad all had girls first so we most likely will have a girl first”. Simple things like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, just 2 days ago my husband said he wanted to start having a family, he said he thinks it will bring us even closer. Also I’m a stay at home wife, I’m unable to work because I was brought here as a young child and don’t have residency. We’re currently in the process with our immigration attorney of getting my visa. He says that having a baby will also be nice because I’ll be able to stay home with him/her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my dilemma. I’ve always thought the only thing I was waiting for was my husband to say “I’m ready!” Then I would take out my birth control and we would start trying. But that’s not really how it’s worked out. I kind of feel something like wedding jitters but I don’t know if its jitters or cold feet? I’m not sure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are living with my parents now, didn’t workout with the in-laws unfortunately but our relationship with them is fine. We will be done fixing a mother-in-law house on my parents property next week and then we move in. So we’ll have space for baby. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here is the thing, he has a good job but we obviously can’t afford to buy our own house since I am not able to work. Since he has been the only one working he’s unable to continue his education and I’m unable to continue mine as well(high school graduates only for now)He makes enough money and all my parents ask us to pay is the water bill ($120~180 every other month) we will be pitching in to the electricity bill once we settle in to the mother in law house though to lighten the load. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband wants a July baby, his birthday is in July and he wants to share that birthday with our baby. That means we have to conceive this month. &lt;/p&gt;

I appreciate any advice I can get here because I don't know what else to do. 

Background- 
My wife and I have been together for 17 years and have 2 sons, 17 and 11. The 17 year old is from a previous relationship, but I came around when he was 6 months old and have been here the whole time. He does know of his real father, but has never met him and his father has never tried to have anything ever to do with him. His father was a drug user and abusive to my wife, but she got out before my son was born. 

He's had emotional issues since he was 6ish. We've tried every parenting thought we can fine have done family therapy, individual therapy, and tried numerous different therapist to try to find a good fit for him. 

At the age of 12 he pointed a pocket knife at my wife, but was just threats and nothing happened, but that was the first real violence that we saw. He has gotten rough with his brother which isn't a constant, but it has happened. He is very 'eye for an eye' in which if anything happens to him the same should happen back, even when his brother was very young. He tries to be very mentally controlling of the people around him and says emotions are weakness and other things along those lines. 

The last therapist he was with said she felt comfortable with him making the decision if he continued and he said he felt he progressed enough to stop and we took his word on it. 

About 3-4 weeks ago we found out that he had become mentally and physically abusive to his girlfriend. She is 18 and graduated HS, but still lives at home. Both sets of parents got involved. We had them not see each other anymore. He had also came out that he had been depressed and started cutting himself. We got him into a new therapist and has been going since. 

We chose this therapist because he's male, which he hasn't had before, and because he's ex military. My son is deferred enlisted into the Marines. Once he graduates, he goes active and goes to boot camp 2 weeks after graduating. 

Me and him have never had a great relationship, before and after letting him know about his real dad. That never really seemed to change much. There's been good and bad times. I've never hit him, there has been yelling and a handful of times he's been spanked. That's by both me and my wife, but majority definitely me. She's very calm and super nurturing. But me and him have had good times. I've been very involved with everything, coached his football till he got to school ball and only ever missing one of his functions.

My brother in law has had a lot of these similar issues in life and is currently in jail. My nephew, my BIL son, is the same age and has been doing the same things. His mom ended up getting police involved and having him taken to a psych living center for about a month. (he's doing much better now)

I'm sure I've missed some background info, so feel free to ask. I'm totally open right now. 



This past weekend-

We had found out that him and his girlfriend had been still seeing each other. We had a conversation about it and the ramifications of what all could happen. Explaining how this isn't helping his depression and what all could happen of they continued this relationship. On Saturday, my younger son had a football and we were gone to it and my older son had Saturday practice. He told us he was going to a buddy's house afterwards which is normal Saturday routine for the linebackers.

Later that afternoon we get a call from his girlfriend's father saying they found them at a hotel together. We drove and picked him up and he started making all kinds of demands and what not and we were calm about it telling him that's not how it works. When we got home he ran out to the road to run off I grabbed his sleeve and arm and he punched me in the face. I grabbed both of his wrists telling him to go back inside. He got a hand free and punched me in the face again. At this point I just let him go. I was very calm during all of that altercation. 

We called the police to file a runaway report. We ended up tracking him down and his youth leader/coach went to talk him down and picked him up. He took him to a close family friend to spend the night and calm down. He had a long talk with him too. 

He came back home yesterday around noon. When we had the altercation in the road, he dropped his sunglasses. Then when he went to find them, they had been ran over. He's making all these demands to get new glasses or he's going to start breaking our stuff. 

He has a session with his therapist tomorrow morning. The therapist has been told all what happened. 



Question-

What the hell do we do? We honestly have zero clue. My wife hasn't even cried, which is weird for her. She says she's done reacting because that's exactly what he wants. 

So just any advice or words or point us in the right direction of articles or anything really. 

Ask me anything you feel is pertinent. I'm an open book on all this. I'm sure I left out a lot, but there's a lot to unpack.


EDIT: I should also mention that he's very in control on this when it's not with family. He is always on beat behavior around others and I have heard nothing but great things about him from others. He's said to a therapist inform of me and my wife that he treats family like shit because he knows that we live him and that we'll be there for him.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First post and it&amp;#39;s gonna be long.

I am 19 and my sisters are 18 and 17, they HATE each other, I used to be like them but I made peace with both of them when I was like 14 and they get along and are close with me but not with each other. Its not just arguing but they have full on fights. I usually just break it up and act like a 3rd parent cause my parents don't really know how to deal with them and they are super rebellious except with me, I have no idea why thats the case but they respect me I guess.

This whole situation started at like 10 or 11, I was with the older sister in the kitchen and when the other one woke up and got pissed that we ate the rest of the cereal. I rolled my eyes knowing there was gonna be another fight, I tried to stop it tho by saying that id go to the store and get more and I planned on doing that cause I really didn't want to hear screaming THIS early in the morning. I got ready and they had full on red faces from yelling, at this point my patience is VERY low. I tell them to shut the fuck up and I walked outside to get fast food for the younger sister as a sorry cause I was the one who took the last of cereal. I came home and the kitchen is DESTROYED. I see my older sister on the floor crying and I go to check up on her and wow it happened again she had a somewhat busted lip (it really wasn't that bad, was just a small cut that bled a lot). I went to my younger sister who locked herself in her room. She finally opened up and she had a bite mark on her hand. My patience is at a all time low and I kinda lost it on her I told her to grow up and she needs to stop fighting cause I'm done picking up the mess every time. She got kinda mad at that and told me that maybe I shouldn't have left and this wouldn't have happened. I didn't say anything and just left. I gave them cleaning supplies and made them clean up the kitchen TOGETHER. If they wanna fight and act like 3 year olds I'm gonna treat them like 3 year olds.

The problem came up when they protested working together and I got my phone out and gave them an ultimatum, they either clean the kitchen together or I get the cops involved since they could technically go to jail for assault. (I would never call the cops on them it was just an empty threat and it worked). Once it was over the older one said that wasn't fair for me to trick them like that, and I told her its not fair for me to deal with your guy's fights either.

When my parents got home I told them about their fight and my trick which made them work together. They laughed at it but then they told me I shouldn't use fear and manipulation to make them work together cause I'm not the parent and need to be their peer not their parental figure. I was shocked they said that and just stayed quiet not wanting to argue with them. I almost said ""well maybe if you guys actually parented them to not fight I wouldn't HAVE to trick them."" But I didn't.

I am tired of them sweeping it under the rug and chalking it up to sibling rivalry cause clearly its not.

My toddler, age two, is *obsessed* with Dude Perfect. After about two months of watching their videos, I’m sick to death of them. It’s not the repetition (I have a high tolerance for that), it’s the fact that it’s such a macho, unhealthy, male-centric version of sports and athleticism.

To make my case, in case anyone needs me to:

- They’ve had a grand total of one woman athlete guest, Serena Williams. Her video with them is great, but in the however many years they’ve been making content, they’ve only represented women in sports *once.* it’s a pathetic tally.
- They use words like “pansy” derogatorily to emasculate each other or assert their masculinity. My son is named after a gay artist, I’m bisexual, I grew up in the LGBT+ and gay activist community, and that kind of language and attitude toward masculinity is absolutely unacceptable to me.
- On-camera, they treat their wives like cute ditzes. (They seem like nice enough people in general that I’d hope they have more respectful and nuanced relationships with their wives off-camera, but who knows.) They had a segment called “Wives Vs. Chad” on Overtime that implies they’d need three women who didn’t know much about sports to beat one man who didn’t know much about sports. In their Stereotypes videos, the women are portrayed as kind of just pretty, spacy, and domestic.
- Some of the stuff they do is straight-up concerning. Case in point, the “Rage Monster” segments of the Stereotypes videos: it’s not funny to become so aggressive in the company of your friends and family that they’re scared of you, it’s abusive.

I just look at this stuff and go, look, this is not a sports culture that I want my son to be a part of. I don’t want him to accept aggression as a normal mode of being for boys and men. I don’t want him to think that women athletes are lesser than male athletes, or that in general women are lesser than men. I don’t want him to have a fragile sense of his masculinity. I don’t want him to be threatened by words like “pansy” or to be ashamed of whatever in his personality is feminine or vulnerable. So the fact that he’s taking in so much of this content bothers me.

I like the idea of being a well-rounded athlete or finding novel ways to have fun and be active. But I just don’t want him to watch this channel anymore.

I really love that, i can't complain about it, but whenever we discuss or clash about something, she talks like i don't appreciate her, that i have to be thankful after everything she has done, and start shouting and making a fuzz. She keeps grounding me for things that i see as childish and stupid, like not being more in the house to do the chores, because i was in a vacation with my SO. For not treating her with respect, for questioning her or even standing up to her. 

I feel like i have a grudge, i feel alone and pushed aside in my own family, and these things make want to grow distant of everyone in the family. I really love them, after all that has happened, but i don't feel like they love me back or even that they care about me. I don't know how to deal with outburst of my mom, i feel attacked, diminished and alone.

Hi! I’m a 21F and my two younger sisters (15F, 10F) are the loves of my life. 

My parents really messed up with me; they don’t know how to parent and instilled insane anxiety and impostor syndrome in me by being insanely strict (like other immigrant families) and not letting me have a social life growing up. I have fought them back and forth for the past 6 years and have managed to get away with having friends, staying out a bit later than my sisters etc. They basically think I’m the devil though, and remind me daily. 

Anyways about my sisters; they’re incredibly brilliant and loving girls. My youngest sister used to be a lot brighter and happy and she has lost a lot of that light in the past couple of years. She is shy now and won’t speak her mind like she used to, and has a twisted self image from how much my mom has fat shamed her. My parents are even stricter on them than they ever were on me. They have no lives at all. I’ve begged my mom to put them in sports and extra curriculars so they can make friends and learn to interact with others, but she says she and dad don’t have time to drive them places (which is fair - they don’t). I’ve been trying for my license for a while now to be that person for them instead of my parents. 

So my question is, how do I - a full time university student with an insane amount of extracurriculars at university - help out my little sisters so they can develop and grow into amazing human beings? I don’t know that I can take over completely, but what can I be doing to cancel out the trauma my parents are putting them through? Any truly concrete things I can be doing are appreciated; money isn’t a huge issue either, within reason. 

Notes: I’ve talked to my mom about putting less restrictions on them. My mom says she gave me more freedom than them and I turned out terrible so she doesn’t want to repeat the process. So that’s not helpful. I also have an older (25F) sister that is a complete hermit and will do anything my mom says (if my mom says to hide the TV remotes from my younger sisters so they study, she makes her do it because she knows she will). She goes on power trips with the 2 as well and enjoys being a part of the restrictions my parents impose on my younger sisters.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR; my parents are taking away my younger sisters lives; what role can I play in stopping/reversing this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m afraid to lose part of myself as I will have to give up all my hobbies and career drive to be there for my child. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When did you know you were ready for all the changes: physically, emotionally, financially, mentally? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you actually prepare?&lt;/p&gt;

Hi, non parent here. Also I was an only child. So growing up I had maybe like 3 birthday parties. I think 1st, 2nd, and 8th. Anyway, my cousins had them for EVERY birthday and as a kid I was kind of sad. My parents told me that they thought it was kind of unnecessary to spoil your kids by having a party every year (even minimalist family only ones are a couple hundred bucks) and have a bunch of people buy them crap every year. Spoiling them through other people essentially. Thoughts/ opinions on that? 

So at these birthday parties i noticed something for kids with siblings. More often than not people (mostly grandparents and the parents) would get 1-a few gifts for the siblings (ive seen cousins too) of the birthday child. I guess its a thing because 20-30 years later and i am seeing it at friends’ kids’ parties too. I’m thinking these children are already very fortunate to have a party/gathering every year... but then they are getting gifts when it is not even their birthday. Simple thought is probably so they don’t feel left out or cry when they aren’t getting anything. But doesn’t that kind if give the impression that just because someone else gets something THEY should too? Or that if they cry/throw a fit they get things to shut them up? Also, make the birthday kid feel a little less special on their day?

I am not trying to judge, just curious as to why? Reasons I’m not considering as well?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two part question. &lt;/p&gt;

I(34,M) and my wife(35,F) had been trying to have a kid since 2013.
Some background of us, I have been working for a company as a salesman for the last 10 years. It's a very small company but as I live in a third world country, work is really hard to find. I do not have the opportunity to grow as the supply for jobs is much higher than the demand. My wife is a house maker and we have been married 8 years. As I said its a third world country so health care or health insurance isn't something we are provided by the company I work for. 

We were first blessed with a kid in the year 2015 but due to some complications my wife had a miscarriage. We cried every day but we couldn't do much about it. 

We were blessed with an another baby daughter in the year 2017 and she is an angel. We have had so many happy moments. My baby is the most precious thing that I have in life. She had always been a skinny kid and we didn't think much of it. We thought its just her physical appearance. She had been constantly falling sick but that is where we were wrong. We thought that kids fall sick all the time. 

A week ago we discovered that our daughter has leukemia. 
22 days ago my baby all of a sudden started swelling. Her stomach was all bloated and we didn't understand what to do about it so we took her to a doctor. Her lymph nodes were all swollen up. 

We couldn't understand what was going on, I did know that lymph nodes are swollen if someone has cancer but no parent on earth would even wish to imagine something so horrible for their kid. She was breathing heavy. My poor baby. 

We went to the doctor. The doctor adviced us for have a few tests. I was there with my kid. It was so horrible to watch. My baby. My poor baby. I wish that she would get all my life. I would trade her life for mine without thinking much. But that is not how it works. 

Yesterday I went to the governments office to seek help but they told me it takes time. My baby doesn't have that.

We talked to the doctors and they advised us that we need to go through a lot of procedures that will make our daughter live. The problem here that we have is it's extremely expensive. The savings we have isn't enough for our daughter and I feel like I have failed as a father.

My wife is blaming me if we loose our daughter, it's on me. As I have been the provider for our house. She literally told me that If I was incapable wealth wise I shouldn't have had a kid. I understand she is panicking. I am ashamed but what do I do?

&lt;p&gt;I am curious about reactions to the college bribery scandal from parents.  I just want the opinions of parents in general, even if your kid is a little far off from college age.  However, before I post my survey, I want to ask, is it ok for me to post my survey?  I noticed in the guidelines that links are automatically removed, and in order to share the survey, I need to post a link to a survey on the qualtrics platform.  The whole thing only takes 10-20 minutes at most.  I would appreciate it if you could let me know if that would be ok.  Thank you for your time.&lt;/p&gt;

I know I can't really change or influence things much cause I'm a 17-year-old senior and he's a 28-year-old man at this point, though I wish I could do something. He had 3 kids: a 5-year-old daughter in kindergarten, a 6-year-old son in 1st grade, and an 11-year-old step-daughter in 6th grade.

I see them every few weeks or so, and whenever they're with there dad and they misbehave, his first response is to be like ""what hell you doing that for?"", and give them a single slap on the back or forehead. His son gets it the worst, probably cause he's just more tough on him since he's a boy, but I've seen him give his daughters lickens once or twice before. It hurts me to see this kinda stuff happening.

Thing is though, this has pretty much been a staple of our family. My mom had my sister in 1988, and then my brother in 1991, and she was tough like this on them too. She used to make them stand with their nose to the corner for 10-20 minutes for saying the wrong thing, and if they were misbehaving, she'd slap them like my brother does his own kids, or my dad would crack them in the back with his leather belt.

When they had me in 2002, they spoiled me and only licked me on rare occasions where I'd misbehaved really bad, but they were still doing that to my siblings as deemed necessary. I remember seeing my dad give my brother a big crack once when I was 5-years-old for loudly arguing with and swearing at my mom over his bad grades. My brother and sister used to babysit me when I was little, and they both took great care of me. My sister never showed any signs of even thinking of doing something like this, she used to spoil me rotten. My brother was a different story; he never got physical with me, but he would sometimes scold me loudly and harshly, and I've seen him get into a bunch of fights with people over the years.

Plus, he's a total chronic. After that incident with my mom and dad, moved out of my mom's household and did junior &amp; senior year with his aunty, who's sons got him into smoking weed, and he hasn't stopped since. When I was little, he used to drive around and hang out at dealer's houses *while I was with him,* and now does the same thing with his kids). He has also been drinking beers and partying for about that long too.

Back when we were all little my mom used to go out to drink and party least once or twice a month, and I still remember one time seeing her coming home late at night puking drunk when I was 7-years-old. My dad also started smoking *and* growing weed himself when I was 9-years-old in 4th grade, and later got into smoking ice before my mom divorced him over having drugs in our house, but by then I was the only kid left in our household.

I'm just worried for these kids a little bit, I know my brother would never let anything bad happen to them, but seeing this just makes me hurt a little inside. Then again, it's been a thing in our family for over 25 years, and my sister and I turned out okay.

I'm really in need of some advice. 

Alittle bit of background:
I am 26 and have a 1yo daughter. My mom was addicted to a prescription drug for more than 10years. She managed to quit about 2 years ago. 
She would do crazy and stupid things while high on it. She'd collapse on the floor while cleaning, say all sorts of nonsense, and lots of other illogical stuff. 
She gave me her drugs when I was 14 and I got hooked up on it for a couple of years. I finally got clean a few years back and regretted every single day on the amount of precious time I had wasted on this crap.

Last night:
My mom has been coming to my place on alternate days to stay over cos she's having relationship issues with my dad. 
Everything was normal until she started cleaning and doing really weird things. I had asked her to stop repeatedly. Her behaviour was just getting more and more odd and down right abnormal. She started talking in a very stone way to my daughter and spouting nonsense to her. She also ransacked my whole house, rearranging every single thing. I got so tired of asking her to stop it and didn't want to argue with her infront of my daughter. It was bed time so I brought my daughter in our room to sleep. 

The lights were completely off, pitch black. My daughter sound asleep (which was rare at 10:30pm, my mom knows how difficult it was to put her to sleep), complete silence and obvious we were sleeping. My mom barged in and asked where is the aircon remote in a loud deafening voice. She would never do this even if we were awake. It was just totally NOT what she would do normally. Even my husband was shocked and 100% sure she was high on something.

I decided it was enough when she had the tv volume up. I asked her what medicine did she take and just tell me honestly. She denied she took any medication. 

This morning, she left for work early and we needed to go for a doctor's appointment. She has misplaced every single object in the house, I couldn't find the things I need to get ready and got really pissed off. I texted her and told her to stop doing this. I asked her to come clean and again, she refused to. I told her to take her medication at her own home, please do not get high in front of my child. 

Am I being rude? I'm really lost and angry at the same time. I feel so betrayed, letting her come stay over as and when she likes, but she disrespected it by doing this. I don't know if I'm overreacting? But I know for sure I do not want my child to witness any of that. Even though she's still really small and probably doesn't know what's going on, but she's at the age where she's starting to mimic what adults do. I'm really afraid if this time its rearranging stuff in my house, what could be next? 
Could she be a danger to my daughter? 

Today she started being really cold and distant towards me. Seems like what a guilty person would do? I don't understand why couldn't she just tell me she took those meds. I am so disappointed in her. 

What should I do in this situation? :(","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I apologise in advance if this is the wrong place for this post. &lt;/p&gt;

So essentially one of my best friends is nearing her birth date and I’d like some advice.

We’re setting up her surprise baby shower for Saturday and everything arranged, we know what she still hasn’t bought or gotten from other people and we have all that on lock down.

My question is: she’s 26 and the baby was a total surprise. She’s been with her boyfriend for ten years but they’re both pretty young and weren’t expecting to have kids this early. She just made the bar and settled as a lawyer and she wanted to live it up a little before having kids now that that part was over and they finally had a bit more money.

I’ve read that a lot of times young parents especially the ones who didn’t plan for the kid can have a hard time adjusting to a new baby and mourn their old life. 

So, as her friend, I’d like to know what I can do to help. Should I buy some books on the topic, about how to deal and give them to her? Or is that too rude? Should I keep in mind small things I can do or say to help out? Offer to babysit once that’s an option for them to go out?

Her family doesn’t live where we live and she has friends here but not a lot of them, so I don’t want her to feel like she’s alone, you know? Since she’s one of my best friends and I know she’s still scared she won’t be able to take proper care of the baby, I’d like to help.

Also, I’m a massive childfree lifestyle fan. She knows and it’s something we’ve talked about a lot over time since we’ve been friends (3 years more or less). I don’t think people shouldn’t have kids, I just don’t want them personally. But I do make a lot of jokes about not liking kids. She knows this is just me being an idiot but I’ve been told that it’s rude because she’s now a new mom or will be and she might resent those comments for a while because she’s still adjusting. Is it really something that might hurt her feelings? I don’t want her to have anything to feel bad about so if it’s really a raw issue, I’ll keep it in mind.

And what can we give her, as her friends, to help her remember she’s her own person? She’s complained people now forget she has a personality beyond being pregnant so I thought it would be nice to give her something just for her. Or like, what can we say or do to help her feel like herself?

I come to you for advice tonight because I'm a scared dad.

He's been a daycare kid at a respected daycare for 4 years and attended pre-K there as well. This year he started kindergarten and things have taken a turn for the worse. He's been touching others where they shouldn't be touched and it happens to him too. The first two incidents were reported to us by his teacher and the rest were able to find out by calming and lovingly talking to him. Of course we let him know someone should never ever be touched in sensitive areas like that but it seems to be a reoccurring issue and school's only been in session 4 weeks.

We do have an appointment with an adolescent therapist next week but I'm wondering if any of you have had something similar occur. I don't feel like asking our parents would help because they're not as understanding and patient as we are. Please help with any thoughts, suggestions, or advice.

My boyfriend has a 6 year old son (whom I love and we have a good relationship). We do not live together, I'm still in school and we aren't there in the relationship yet. But we've been dating for a while and I've known the kid since he was 4.

The whole time I've known them they have co-slept in the same bed, and shared the same room. At first I didnt think a lot about it. I figured it's not that big of a deal because hes so young, and that within a year my boyfriend would stop renting out his extra room, and have it for his kid. This hasn't happened.

He still doesn't have the option for his kid to have his own room, something he could do financially if he really wanted to.  And honestly at this point it's making me a little uncomfortable. Not because I have an agenda and want to ""have that space for myself"" but because his son doesn't even have the option.  I would imagine at 6 his kid is too old to not have his own room (or for his kid to at least the option and encouragement to have his own space)?

I've also noticed that when we go to the park his son ONLY wants to play with us. It can be very hard to get him to play with other kids. He has said many times that he only wants to play with us, or that he will play alone. This has been another red flag for me. It's made worse by the fact that my boyfriend doesn't make any play-dates with any other kids on the weekends. So it's only him and his son.

I'm really worried that he is developing some bad codependency issues, and if his environment doesn't change this could be bad for him later on. I understand having a good relationship with your kid, spending time with them and being there for them are all super important. But I'm starting to get worried about his son's social skills and development later on because of all of this. On top of it seeming seeming a little weird?

If anyone has any thoughts I'd love to hear them. I'm also totally open to hearing that I'm just crazy and I shouldnt be too worried about it.

Now I'm wondering if I just made things worse by planting that seed in her mind... did I do the right thing?**

I (19F) went to visit my family (2 sisters, 11F and 9F) this past weekend. They still live with my mom and dad (50F and 51M), who are bad parents at best, but some might consider them abusive parents. I don't know.

I moved out 2 months after I turned 18 because I couldn't take them anymore. My dad has a brain injury so he's a lot more angry than he used to be, but he was still insufferable before that. My mom is controlling and likes to use her power to make her kids feel like garbage. I still keep in contact with my mom and see them and stuff, but my main reason for visiting is to see my younger siblings.

The middle child (11F) seems the most affected by our messed up parents. Understandable, because she seems to constantly get in trouble. She's not a bad kid but she's less-liked than our other sister (9F), and she can probably tell, so she acts out. I try to be there for her but she pushes me away (both figuratively and literally), yells, screams, swears, the whole bit. 

Anyway, when I was over this past weekend, I was helping 11F with her homework. We were on a math problem, and I tried to explain it to her but I wasn't sure if I was explaining it at her grade level. She said she never learned anything that I was explaining. Her teacher just gave her this question as a tester question to ""see where the class was at"" - aka it wasn't necessary homework, since the class hadn't learned it yet. I said no problem, I was doing a bad job explaining the question, she didn't get it, she said she'd rather have the teacher explain it. No biggy, we just finished all the other homework and closed the books up. Well, I guess it wasn't ""no biggy"" to my mom, because she started SCREAMING at 11F, said she HAD to do the question OR ELSE. Mom ended up taking away all of 11F's fun things (paints, sketchbooks, laptop, etc etc etc). Mom said ""I just might forget where I hide these..."", which upset 11F even more (mom does stuff like that all the time; taunts 11F to upset her) and then my mom called 11F a ""foolish child"" for trying to ""play games with her"" and mom said she would ""teach her a lesson"".

11F slammed the door and was bawling her eyes out. I went to go check on her and instantly got emotional. Usually 11F is very confrontational, she'll scream and swear if you go to check up on her. But this time, she just had her head hunt low. She looked defeated. I remember feeling the way she did when I was her age, and our mom did the same stuff to me. I said ""I'm sorry I didn't explain your homework very well.. you didn't deserve to get in trouble."" She shrugged. 
I told her ""I know mom and dad aren't the best parents.. I'm sorry you live in this situation. I'm sorry I moved out. I'm sorry I didn't stay here so you didn't have to live with them alone.""
11F said something along the lines of ""I don't know why they're always yelling at *me*""
I said ""I don't know. They did it to me too. But if you ever need me or if things get really bad, you can always call me. I'll come immediately.""
She said ""okay.""

I sat there and kept my arm around her. I was sniffling and tears were running down my face at this point. We went back to the math, I told her the answer and just got her to write it down. I told my mom ""11F figured out the answer! she did great!"", and then I went and convinced our mom to give 11F's stuff back, since she did end up doing her homework. 

Kind of a long story but... did I do the wrong thing by telling her our parents aren't great? Like, maybe she never thought that about our parents but now that I told her she does? I don't know.

&lt;p&gt;Kind of a long story but... did I do the wrong thing by telling her our parents aren&amp;#39;t great? Like, maybe she never thought that about our parents but now that I told her she does? I don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;m so lost in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

But GOD hes so so so attached to my mum that I'm actually really concerned. He sleeps in the same bed as her and refuses to sleep anywhere else. Hes done this for years and years, hes probably rarely ever slept by himself at night. My mum hates it but she lets him do it since it means he actually sleeps and that she doesn't have to fight with him. BUT it gets worse from here. When my mum puts him to bed she has to sit and cuddle with him for up to an hour before he'll even consider going to sleep (even then he sometimes doesn't), once shes done cuddling with him she CANNOT go downstairs bc B will shout for her, saying over and over again that hes scared and that he cant sleep, he will also follow her downstairs and refuse to go back up by himself. My mum has now been forced to stay upstairs and have a really long bath until B falls asleep because she just cant leave him. He also struggles with going to school and says he misses her, doesn't want to leave her, etc. He also says similar things before going to his Dad's house on sundays.

She doesnt regulate what he watches AT ALL, and its not even kids YouTube he watches, he watches the normal YouTube. Hes probably watching things that are too old for him and scaring himself, hence hes too scared to sleep.

I need help identifying this item: [https://imgur.com/FwgPX86](https://imgur.com/FwgPX86)

**Description**: Pink baby blanket in polyester, with decorative sewing in white thread. Decorative eyes on one corner, and an ""appendix"" of the same fabric in the other. This ""appendix"" is the most important part. If you can find a blanket with this part but everything else different, it'll work too!

There are no tags are anything else with text or numbers. Can't remember if it had and was ripped off, or if it never had.

**Size**: 87 cm by 84 cm, or 34 by 33 inches. I can provide more photos and details if needed.

**Backstory**: When my daughter was born, 3 years ago, we received a lot of gifts and free samples. Among them was this baby blanket. She took to it and it is now her comfort item. She sleeps with it every night, she named it and even named the little part that sticks out in one of the corners (what I called the appendix).

Ever since then, I have been looking for this blanket so we can have a replacement if we need to. I reached out to everyone who gifted us presents but no-one remembers gifting this. I believe this may have been a gift that came with some baby related product, but my Google-fu returned nothing useful.

This baby blanket is now showing evident signs of wear and tear, and although it is still in good shape I fear for the day it rips. I know that dealing with loss is part of a child's development, but I would rather my girl chooses to give up her comfort blanket instead of having it break and be left without a choice.

So please, people of Reddit, help me find this pink blanket somewhere where I can purchase it!

If you find a better place for me to post this please let me know.

I'm not a parent but an auntie who adores her nephews and nieces.
I'm usually very good with kiddos but sometimes the parents get me very annoyed.
Today I clashed with a young mum and I'm wondering if I did anything wrong. I'd also welcome helpful tips for dealing with unpleasant situations involving parents.
On to the story...
I'm part of an international group of women who come together once a month to have brunch or cocktails. The group is strictly girls only because sometimes you just need a girlfriend to talk to.
There is one young woman who keeps bringing her toddler to these events. I, as do others in the group are a bit annoyed by this but as long as the organiser allows it we try to ignore it. Today we had brunch and mum had her toddler barefoot in a diaper and a legless onesie. The kid was running around, quietly playing with toys, no big deal. Then she takes him on her lap and lets him crawl and stand on the dining table. I find this very unhygienic (even though the food hadn't yet arrived) but don't really know how to approach the subject. The event organiser says something in a light hearted fashion but mum ignores it. All I think about is dirty feet and that diaper so I muster the courage and ask her if she could please keep het toddler's feet off the table because I find it very unappetising. She gets angry and defensive and packs up her stuff to move to the other end of the table.
I have a hard time standing up for myself so her reaction really got to me.
So my questions: Should I not have said anything? Should I maybe have removed myself or should I have worded it differently?

Hoping I can get some tips and advice that will help me. I have a friend I had in high school staying with me  for a ""vacation""  with her 2 little ones 2 years old and 4 years old. The friend was originally supposed to stay with another friend, but due to lack of space at other friends house, it would have been really cramped. Friend asked me if they can stay with me, and I said yes, stupid me said yes before asking for how long she was planning on staying. So she and her littles are with me for 3 weeks.

Anyways. The friend staying with me, I knew before she had her children. I'm now finding out how very hands off she is with her children. She sits in the living room on her phone playing games and FB'ing, while the children run around fighting, whining and just being children. She has no schedule for them, they go to bed at any time (last night was midnight), and when they act up she just simply says ""go to your room"", or ""go play"", or if she's really fed up she just spanks them. 

I'm not one to judge or really care about her parenting style, I guess I just need advice on how to interact with these children and also kind of tell my friend nicely that her and her children are overwhelming my household, without offending anyone. I have a 5 month old, a husband who works from home, and I work 4 days a week 8a-4p. The only transportation she relies on is our other friend who has the kids car seats in her car. She has no schedule set for what she does with the kids during the day. I planned a few outings for them, but like I said before I have my own little one and work!

We have generally eaten dinner as a family fairly early (5:30-6ish) and start bedtime shortly after. (My kids are 7 and 4). We've just started entering into the stage of life with evening sports practices and I'm trying to wrap my head around good strategies for dinner. We only have 2 evenings right now (1 activity per kid) but I'd like to get some good habits in place because I can imagine it'll increase as they get older and interested in doing more. As an example, the one night we have a practice that's 5:45-6:45. Including travel to and from, we're gone from the house about 5:15-7:15.

We&amp;#39;ve just started entering into the stage of life with evening sports practices and I&amp;#39;m trying to wrap my head around good strategies for dinner. We only have 2 evenings right now (1 activity per kid) but I&amp;#39;d like to get some good habits in place because I can imagine it&amp;#39;ll increase as they get older and interested in doing more. As an example, the one night we have a practice that&amp;#39;s 5:45-6:45. Including travel to and from, we&amp;#39;re gone from the house about 5:15-7:15.

This has been going on for over a month now. There is a parent of one of my child's close friends. The school they go to does not have a bus system and is not walking distance (15 minute drive or so). The mom of the kid asked me if I would pick him up most days and I said I could do it that week but that I couldn't commit long term. It has really spiraled. The mom does not drive. The one time I didn't pick him up the mom guilt tripped me that his ride was an hour and a half late and he had a panic attack. These are preteens btw. 
I don't know why they would send him to a school that they didn't have transportation. I am okay with giving him a ride once in a great while...but it is effecting my schedule (I have to get back to another school to pick up one of my other childreb). They dont ask me and dont tell their son who is taking him home and he stands around confused calling everyone making me late. Every day she has an excuse for some major drama (dumb stuff) that has prevented her from texting me to ask me to get him. I don't have that much of a problem with driving him but after a near major accident in front of me driving today I began to get worried about the liability. This mom was never that friendly with me the 5 or so years I have known her. I just got really bad news that my husband has cancer and I dont know what is going on or what stage or anything yet but he doesnt want anyone other than really close immediate family to know (literally only 4 people besides myself knows). I told her that the carpooling wasnt really going to be working out anymore but that I couldnt tell her why because my kids dont know and it's like she didnt get the message because she assumed I was picking him up today even though I told her that yesterday. I feel like the free uber. The kid doesnt even say thank you (though I know kids are just oblivious). He has made me late countless times to get my other child to where I told my kid to have a talk with him that he needs to hurry because I have only 20 minutes before my youngest gets out and I have to sign him out with the teacher and its 15 minutes from this school.

I need to tread lightly as it is a neighbor and parent of my kids friend and will be at the same school for at least a few more years so I dont want it to be awkward.

I'd like to make clear from the start that I am NOT a parent, but the oldest son of the family which has taken on a parenting-like-role in the past 2 years. This will end up being a longer post, primarily explaining the situation and asking for alternative solutions or tips. Further information that might help understand the situation: My dad works full time and travels a lot for his work. My younger brother is 15 from the start of this ""story"" weighing around 160 pounds.

To shortly introduce myself. I am 21 years old and the oldest son of the family. I have recently left my home to pursue studies abroad. For the past 2 years I have been in charge of trying to ""battle"" the issues my younger brother has had. Now that I've left, it has only become worse.

Most of these issues started when we moved to the USA, previously having lived in Germany. As an ""oil family"" moving country every few years was nothing new, however when moving from Germany to the USA half of my family stayed in Germany to settle down whilst my dad, my younger brother and I moved. I loved the idea of moving to the US as I've never previously been there, and so did my brother. We settled in quickly and as already fluent English speakers, there wasn't an overwhelming lot to get used to. Soon later the school year started and he was seemingly happy with his classes and the school. As a note, we both attended different schools. As the school year went by, my brother slowly gained weight, went to school less and less and hid away more and more, dedicating his time towards video games. All these things were still within reasonable bounds after the first year had passed.

Now onto the second year of school in the US. His attendance at school rapidly decreased to a point where my dad would have to regularly call school to ensure he isn't thrown out. His attendance was now around 2-3 days a school week (out of 5 days). As an excuse he would use the usual ""I'm sick"", to ""I've got diarrhea so I can't go"" or ""I didn't complete what I had to do for school and I don't want to get in trouble"". Obviously we believed him the first few times, but as attendance went down, so did our trust in what he said. I tried to explain to him that even if he didn't do the school work that he was meant to do, he should go to school and face the consequences rather than hide away at home, as it doesn't resolve anything. Sadly, my words had little to no impact and, no matter what we would say, wouldn't motivate him or change his mind. Now some of you might be thinking; why not just force him to school anyways?. That would a lot easier said than done. I'm sure you are all aware how difficult it is to make a child do something he doesn't want to do. No matter the consequences to both him and us as a family or after explaining to him that the future he wants (to become a foreign diplomat/a politician) will only be possible if he changes his behavior, he wouldn't give it and further stay home.

At this point we had taken away his PC rights for the time where he should've been at school and he only gets access while we're home. Completely taking away the computer has not been an option thus far, as he uses it for his school resources/writing essays and so forth. Personally, I am still convinced the computer is part of the reason he doesn't wish to go to school. He himself however doesn't tell us the true reason he doesn't want to go, even after offering for him to talk to a psychologist, or endless heartfelt conversations with him. It seems to be a block which he cannot overcome.

Whilst all this has been going on, he also started to steal my dads credit card to order food and buy games online. When confronted with what he had done, he always denied it. He started hiding away the empty or partially eaten food all over the house. In drawers, cupboards, hidden away corners, under his bed and even in my bathroom. After finding the remains he'd insist it was month ago that he had last ordered food. Before accusing him of anything we'd always check the order date seen on the card invoice alongside the date which is printed on the packaging of the ordered food. After being confronted with the evidence he'd further deny any of it was him and get rather aggressive. He'd never get physical though.

For the past 5 months he has been put on a low-carb diet from his doctor to help with weight loss (250 pounds at age 17). I was done with high school but didn't get start my university degree so I would stay home with him and cook for him while my dad was at work. This worked great and he seemed to have gained a new wave of motivation to get better. He started losing weight slowly, he went to school a bit more, he didn't spend all his time hidden away in his room anymore. My dad and I were both happy for him and showed him our appreciation and how proud of him we were.

Now to where it all went downhill, again. I moved abroad to go to uni about 2 months ago and he started his 3rd year of school in the states, having to repeat the previous one for the lack of attendance. He happily went to school for the first week and then nothing. In the past 2 months he has gone to school a total of 3 times. That is 3 out of 40 days of school. His old habits of stealing credit cards was resumed and alongside it the hiding of food around the house.

In defense of my dad, his long work hours and frequent traveling strongly limits what he can do, any help he has tried to organize or even do himself has been met with strong rejection from my younger brother. Now that I am no longer there to assist him, his possibilities have only further been drained.

My family and I are in desperate need for any advice at all, as we have exhausted anything we could think of. This wasn't easy for me to open up with as it is quite a personal matter. I appreciate any form of help.

We settled in quickly and as already fluent English speakers, there wasn&amp;#39;t an overwhelming lot to get used to. Soon later the school year started and he was seemingly happy with his classes and the school. As a note, we both attended different schools. As the school year went by, my brother slowly gained weight, went to school less and less and hid away more and more, dedicating his time towards video games. All these things were still within reasonable bounds after the first year had passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now onto the second year of school in the US. His attendance at school rapidly decreased to a point where my dad would have to regularly call school to ensure he isn&amp;#39;t thrown out. His attendance was now around 2-3 days a school week (out of 5 days). As an excuse he would use the usual &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sick&amp;quot;, to &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve got diarrhea so I can&amp;#39;t go&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t complete what I had to do for school and I don&amp;#39;t want to get in trouble&amp;quot;. Obviously we believed him the first few times, but as attendance went down, so did our trust in what he said. I tried to explain to him that even if he didn&amp;#39;t do the school work that he was meant to do, he should go to school and face the consequences rather than hide away at home, as it doesn&amp;#39;t resolve anything. Sadly, my words had little to no impact and, no matter what we would say, wouldn&amp;#39;t motivate him or change his mind. Now some of you might be thinking; why not just force him to school anyways?. That would a lot easier said than done. I&amp;#39;m sure you are all aware how difficult it is to make a child do something he doesn&amp;#39;t want to do. No matter the consequences to both him and us as a family or after explaining to him that the future he wants (to become a foreign diplomat/a politician) will only be possible if he changes his behavior, he wouldn&amp;#39;t give it and further stay home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point we had taken away his PC rights for the time where he should&amp;#39;ve been at school and he only gets access while we&amp;#39;re home. Completely taking away the computer has not been an option thus far, as he uses it for his school resources/writing essays and so forth. Personally, I am still convinced the computer is part of the reason he doesn&amp;#39;t wish to go to school. He himself however doesn&amp;#39;t tell us the true reason he doesn&amp;#39;t want to go, even after offering for him to talk to a psychologist, or endless heartfelt conversations with him. It seems to be a block which he cannot overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst all this has been going on, he also started to steal my dads credit card to order food and buy games online. When confronted with what he had done, he always denied it. He started hiding away the empty or partially eaten food all over the house. In drawers, cupboards, hidden away corners, under his bed and even in my bathroom. After finding the remains he&amp;#39;d insist it was month ago that he had last ordered food. Before accusing him of anything we&amp;#39;d always check the order date seen on the card invoice alongside the date which is printed on the packaging of the ordered food. After being confronted with the evidence he&amp;#39;d further deny any of it was him and get rather aggressive. He&amp;#39;d never get physical though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past 5 months he has been put on a low-carb diet from his doctor to help with weight loss (250 pounds at age 17). I was done with high school but didn&amp;#39;t get start my university degree so I would stay home with him and cook for him while my dad was at work. This worked great and he seemed to have gained a new wave of motivation to get better. He started losing weight slowly, he went to school a bit more, he didn&amp;#39;t spend all his time hidden away in his room anymore. My dad and I were both happy for him and showed him our appreciation and how proud of him we were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to where it all went downhill, again. I moved abroad to go to uni about 2 months ago and he started his 3rd year of school in the states, having to repeat the previous one for the lack of attendance. He happily went to school for the first week and then nothing. In the past 2 months he has gone to school a total of 3 times. That is 3 out of 40 days of school. His old habits of stealing credit cards was resumed and alongside it the hiding of food around the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In defense of my dad, his long work hours and frequent traveling strongly limits what he can do, any help he has tried to organize or even do himself has been met with strong rejection from my younger brother. Now that I am no longer there to assist him, his possibilities have only further been drained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family and I are in desperate need for any advice at all, as we have exhausted anything we could think of. This wasn&amp;#39;t easy for me to open up with as it is quite a personal matter. I appreciate any form of help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

 So it’s been two months living separate divorce was final sept 6th. My child misses him. 

But wants him to stay at “ home” which would be my house the main home and I am full custody.

My ex is dragging his feet on getting a permanent living space which pisses me off as well. 

But right now he does have a decent apartment with his mother. 


But our little one will hangout there then come bedtime he wants to come home badly. 

I know as parents we should set the schedule,  not him. But this happened  last wed. We caved and let him return home to sleep. 

Now here we are Wednesday this is his night to stay and I have a feeling he isn’t going to want too. 

Should he just not do overnights until he is adjusted a bit more? 

Or maybe only once a week not multiple nights over a full weekend... not school nights , idk it breaks my heart into a billions of  pieces. 

I know,  he knows how the arguing was very much affecting him and I, he knows why dada left the house. 

But he can’t see the big picture. The chaotic environment was way worse than the divorce. 

I don’t doubt my decision. Is there a recommended book or movie that is a good way to start a discussion about adjusting to divorce with a hound child? Idk it’s really upsetting. All of it is. 


I can’t help but to hate the ex for what a mess he made of our family. It’s enraging. He is crazy, he really is nothing else explains it. 
The ups and downs the delusional thinking the anger, god the selfishness!!! 

He loves our child no doubt but his selfishness , mental state and abusive ways destroyed my love for him and now our child has a split home.

My son is an only child and 10 yr old.  He is invited to a sleepover bday party this coming weekend.  It will be his first time sleeping away from home except a single night he spent with gma.  The house where this will be happening has much more lax rules about media consumption than we have at our house.  We aren't puritans, but we do check in with [commonsensemedia.org](https://commonsensemedia.org) to read about various media offerings to decide whether we should let our son indulge.  He's super emo and violence in particular freaks him out.

He has told me that the bday boy gets to play X, Y, and Z video games that are rated ""T"" for ""teen"" and these games will likely be on center stage at the party -- we don't love that but aren't going to lose our shit over it either.  Today son told me that there is a plan to watch a movie that my son hasn't seen before (older movie, not going to name it because I don't want to get into any nitpicky discussions about its particular age-appropriateness) and it's a movie I've seen many times.  It's generally ok for this age and commonsensemedia rates it as appropriate for ages 11 and above.   There are two particularly violent scenes in this movie that my son knows about and has said he definitely doesn't want to watch.

I guess I'm not sure how to handle this, nor how to advise my kid.  Obviously I don't want him teased for getting upset at viewing things that are upsetting to him (and at bedtime, too).  I just really wish the parent overseeing the party would opt for ""too young"" media choices rather than more mature choices, but I can't control that and don't really want to bring it up with her.  I am friendly with her but it's a pretty new friendship and I don't want to step on any toes.

I'm kind of unsure of what to think.   It's such a borderline age (the bday boy is turning 11) where they want to explore more grown-up stuff but they're not necessarily ready for it emotionally.

&lt;p&gt;My brother on the other hand, still has EVERYTHING done for him. And that’s not an exaggeration. My mom checks his bank account weekly to make sure he isn’t wasting his money. She makes his lunch every day. She makes him separate dinners each night because he’s picky instead of making him eat normal foods - I honestly don’t think he has eaten a single fruit or vegetable in years. She even makes his plate and brings it to him while he’s watching tv on the couch or in his room. All of his doctor, dentist, etc appointments are made for him. His laundry gets done for him and gets put away in his drawers. His room gets cleaned for him. I don’t think he even buys his own clothes or anything either. When he was in college, I got in trouble for not wanting to help him figure out how to buy his books each year and saying he should be able to figure it out on his own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m constantly being told I need to stop being so mean about this and leave him be. But how is he supposed to become responsible!? Am I wrong for thinking that this is not ok for someone his age!?&lt;/p&gt;

My mom was lucky, I guess, as she said I'd eat pretty much anything I was served (and she always served healthy, nutritious meals). So it's hard for me to understand this phenomenon.

The scouting part is for a year-long study abroad program I want to do next year. Now, I only told my mom and brother about this like 2 weeks ago, and I still haven't told my dad. My trip is in 3 weeks, and I'm getting more and more terrified of telling him as the day draws near. Now, before you tell me to just suck it up buttercup and tell him, hear me out. There's more to the story. He got asked to resign recently and is now looking for out-of-state jobs. He plans to bring my mom and youngest brothers with him wherever he goes, and leave me and my next oldest brother in charge of the house. Theoretically, that sounds good, doesn't it? I can save money and stay at home, and he'll be out of my hair, too. But I don't know when this will happen . It could be in 2 weeks, it could be in 2 months. And I don't think he'll react favorably if I tell him about this trip. At all. He never approves of ""my crazy ideas"", even though this is the first time in my life that I feel pretty confident about what I'm doing for my career. So, I'm afraid that he'll get so angry at me and kick me out, once and for all. He's threatened to do it many times before, so I don't know. What I'm feeling guilty about is that we're in a tough financial situation because of him losing his job and a debt we owe to relatives. I saved up money for this trip on my own, and I'm not asking for anything at all from my parents, but I know they won't understand. My mom keeps asking why I want to go, what could possibly be better than America? (We're immigrants) My dad will say that I'm ""betraying"" the family, which he's said before. So, am I awful for wanting to break off on my own and use my funds just for myself and not to help my family?

Not that I dont want to, but more of, I need a break. Especially my husband considering he spends most of his time at home cleaning and working at the same time. He gets to see the kids right before and after school so it's pretty exhausting.

The only time that we ever get some alone time at home is when my daughter decides to go have a sleepover at her friend's house and her brother comes along. But that hasn't happened in 6 months. 

And I'm ( just a little bit ) desperate for a sense of relief, be it a nice dinner out and maybe a little something later on or a relaxing movie night without having to worry about waking up the kids for school the next day. I just dont know how to get them away for a little while 

We've tried asking my husband's brother's and sisters if they could just keep the two in their household for just a few days. Even they are busy with their own children. And I couldn't ever give my kids to their grandparents ( we arent in the most stable relationship ATM )

- I have a soon to be 9 year old son (I’ll call him Jake.) 

- I share joint 50/50 custody with his dad (who I will call Will. Also, the custody agreement was has been in place in 2012 and hasn’t been changed). 

- Due to my struggles with mental health, I took a step back out of my Jakes life to become more stable.

-  Will had some issues of his own over the last few years. 

- Because his dad and myself have been battling our own inner demons, my sons grandma stepped in to help raise him (this is Wills mom. Let’s call her Karen). 

-  I was always allowed to see Jake whenever I wanted to. When I would visit with him, it would be at Karen’s house. 

- Due to some events that happened the end of May, I have moved back into Wills house (not in a romantic way. Just a friend renting a room) and I am now back Jakes daily life. 

Here’s the problem: Karen doesn’t want me back in Jakes daily life. She wants me to disappear again. She resents the idea of me being a mom and repairing my relationship with him. Jake has told me a few times that Karen doesn’t like me being at Wills house and doesn’t like me in general. This is leading me to believe that Karen has been bad mouthing me to Jake. I also think Karen is worried that we will pull Jake away from her (which we would never do). 

Recently, Jake has started becoming more defiant and his anger is starting to come out. 
I talked with Jake and I said that I know that I haven’t been around the last few years in order to be the mom he needs and I think since we (meaning Will and myself) don’t allow him to do some of the things that Karen allows him to do that he is getting confused and it’s causing him to be frustrated. (He’s been saying things like ‘my grandma lets me do that. Maybe I’ll go to my grandmas and not come here anymore!’) He said yes to being confused and frustrated. 

I’ve vented my frustrations to my dad about the whole situation. My dad made the comment of telling Karen that we are Jakes parents, she’s just the grandma and tell her how things are going to be. I told Will about what my dad said and he started chuckling. He said that if we were to do that that Karen wouldn’t talk to either us for a long time and she wouldn’t help out anymore. 

About two weeks ago I gave Karen a peace offering gift (it was pictures from a mini back to school photo session we had done for Jake) and a letter. In the letter I told her how grateful I am for everything she’s done for Jake and how she will always be a big part of his life. In the letter I asked her if she would be willing to go to a few therapy sessions with me so we could learn how to communicate.

I feel much better now about handling this. I received a lot of very helpful advice that I will put to use. Thank you all!

**Background:** I am almost 30 years old and not quite 12 weeks pregnant with a somewhat surprise baby (I was considered very unlikely to conceive due to severe PCOS). At first I and my husband were excited and confident in our ability to make it work. I had a close relationship with one of my (late) parents and looked forward to having something similar -- to nurturing a life, to watching them experience new things. Since so many of family have died (parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins), I was excited about finally having new life around. However, our extended families have been so pushy with how expensive, time-consuming, and deadening child-rearing is, that I've started to seriously freak out.

**Financial Concerns:** Between the expected hospital bills, the loss of my husband's income (his income won't cover childcare, so he'll have to stay home), trying to figure out how many days I can miss work for delivery, anticipating the increased expenses (diapers, food, clothes), I'm borderline suicidal. I make about $50,000 gross a year, which is fine for just a couple, but looking over the budget, it seems awfully tight for supporting a child that's estimated by the [USDA](https://www.cnpp.usda.gov/tools/CRC_Calculator/default.aspx) to cost at minimum $6,000 per year (I excluded childcare and housing). It's dawning on me how completely on our own with this, and how isolating and stressful parenthood in the USA is destined to be...for the next two decades of my life. Somewhat related, the world seems like it's going to hell, and here I am, unprepared and bringing new life into it, which seems selfish of me. In sum, I come from a background extreme power-off sell-yourself childhood poverty, and I worked for a decade to sling myself onto the lowest rung of the professional classes, and it's incredibly nerve-racking to think I could've just grenaded myself right back off the success ladder. At the end of the day, I don't want the child to experience the financial instability I did.

**Personal Concerns:** I'm also panicking that I'll cease to be ""me"" and become a sleepless automaton focused solely on pumping milk and changing diapers, with all of my rich hobbies (music, comics), cultivated over decades, evaporating into thin air. I've been taking college classes online to try to increase my earning power, but I don't see how that can continue, either, thereby condemning myself to the same career path for the foreseeable future -- all plans for moving up in the world, savings, waylaid indefinitely.  I've also read that motherhood ages women severely, and that marriages (which I value so highly) go from romantic partnerships to mere business ones -- roommates impassively working together to manage the child's endless needs. Then, there's our two cats, once a source of pleasure, sure now to be just another chore once the baby appears. Finally, I can't even begin to envision dredging through 10 hours of work each day on just a few hours of sleep for months on end. I see parents online constantly reassuring each other that the never-ending sacrifice is worth it, but I'm starting to have my doubts.

**Need for Advice:** My parents are both dead (they died very young), so there's no help to be had there, and I have no close peers with children, so it's hard to find objective opinions. I tried talking with my husband and just ended up freaking him out, too. The in-laws have made it clear they plan to be Kodak grandparents, and the one time I tried to even hint to an older relative that I was worried about managing all of the responsibilities, I was simply chastised that all parents go through this and that I was being selfish and needed to grow up. I understand that's technically true, but it seems unfair that I'm supposed to process these emotions without any opportunity to receive constructive advice (besides ""suck it up!"") or even vent. Finally, I was also severely emotionally abused as a child (one of my parents was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder but couldn't afford treatment) and have some residual mental issues from that (though I've come a long way), so I know my thought patterns might not be realistic...even though they *feel* so real and heavy. I'm hoping this is simply my mental illness rearing its irrational head (for the record, I am looking into resuming therapy specifically for the pregnancy, but work makes it difficult), and that I've merely catastrophized. Or maybe this is all true, but somehow it will be okay and I'll get through this. I just feel that if the situation is a dire as I've now convinced myself, it seems impossible to be managed.

So, parents of Reddit, you're the only people I can think to ask about these concerns. I know many of you have experienced similar things, and I ask you for your wisdom. I appreciate you taking the time to read this long and negative rant, and for taking the time to respond.

It’s a networking meeting where the primary focus will be how to help my sister’s two children, a boy age 8, Bradley, and a girl age 5, Maya. My biggest concern here is Bradley. He is a traumatized kid whose behavior has become extremely aggressive &amp; defiant and only seems to be getting worse. We are looking to go into this meeting with constructive ideas for how we as a family can get these kids the help they need and to help my sister before she loses custody of them.

So, here is a breakdown of the situation.

We think Bradley became traumatized mainly because of his father, Brian. Brian is a racist, angry, drug addict. He had been in recovery along with my sister, Susan, for several years but relapsed 2 years ago leading to my sister leaving him for the good of the kids. However, Brian is very manipulative, often losing his temper at Bradley to the point Maya gets afraid and cries. Brian is not legally allowed to be alone with the kids due to his drug use, but my sister has a form of Asperger’s syndrome and has trouble saying no. He takes her money and must always know where she is and what she’s doing all the time. He also will just go over to her apartment when he wants and then get angry at Susan &amp; the kids for the smallest things. We have talked to Susan about spending less time with him but it’s nearly impossible and now she’s lying about seeing him because she knows what we think about that and how it could affect her having custody.

We know there are other factors than just Brian. The area they lived in was very poor with a lot of low income and refugee households. Violence is a regular occurrence in the area and my sister was even attacked there once by a man for telling off his child who nearly ran over Maya on a motorbike in a playground. Bradley has been subject to a lot of bullying and has already had to change school because of it. He may have to do so again because it is happening at his new school too.

Bradley is not simply a victim though. He has developed into a violent, mouthy brat with no boundaries. We know he is bringing the bullying on himself and is exhibiting bullying behaviors too. We think that it’s more that he seems to copy learned behavior that he’s picked up from his dad and other bullies as he certainly isn’t a ringleader and can be quite reserved until he gets riled up. He hasn’t had specific one to one therapy, but he has been to group therapy meetings with a group of other children who have parents living with drug addiction and/or mental health issues to help him with his feelings. He likes the group, but we haven’t noticed any improvement in his behavior.

Nobody sets boundaries with him except me and my husband. My sister lets him get his way all the time and never punishes or provides consequences for his behavior because it’s easier and when he doesn’t get his way, he gets super aggressive and calls his mum a fucking whore and stupid idiot and so on. He will also refer to me and my husband like this when angry or trying to provoke us for fun. A big problem with Bradley and my sister’s relationship is not only that she gives in to him too much but also that she treats him more like a friend than her son and doesn’t prevent him from overhearing things from the lives of her friends who still have relationships with other drug addicts. For example, he knows the difference between being arrested &amp; being apprehended and how many days the police can keep you on certain charges. These are things I barely know anything about and certainly something he shouldn’t know at his age.

A major issue we face, that caused a huge argument between me and Bradley 2 weeks ago, is hygiene. Because of my sister’s Asperger’s she lacks quite severely in hygiene and it has begun to affect her kids. Bradley often refuses to shower which makes him smell quite bad. They’re always dirty and so my mum and I basically always make sure they bathe or shower when we see them. He doesn’t understand why he must shower or even why he must use soap. I think this is part of the reason he also gets bullied at school as well. Bradley refused to shower after an evening sports class and ended up with me carrying him, kicking, screaming and swearing at me, my sister and Maya out into the street and into my car.

His behavior is totally unacceptable and I’m at my wits end. He is especially mean to my husband because they don’t speak the same language and he hasn’t quite figured out that my husband knows enough of our language to understand what Bradley is saying to him. All the children in our family roughhouse quite hard and need to be reminded to keep it in check but Bradley can switch to deliberately trying to inflict as much damage as possible in an instant and will get a good laugh out of drawing blood. He is a violent kid who thinks kicking and punching is fun. I’ve caught him many times being violent towards his cousin, who is 6 years old. It makes me worry about what he could be doing to his little sister, but she is still a mostly happy girl who so far is just scared of her dad when he’s angry.

We have tried to take more interest in the kids’ lives and be there for them, buying them clothes so they don't only get 2nd hand stuff. We take them to hobbies to try and engage them with groups outside of school and have constructive outlets for their anger. We try to be consistent when they are with us. We don't get angry with them, but we are clear about what behavior isn’t acceptable such as the swearing and violence, and we ensure our home is well maintained so that they understand that it isn't normal not to clean or wash.

We are very hesitant about buying new toys for Bradley as we have seen him destroy gifts the same day, he receives them. Our other nephews have received a new laptop and a kitten from us this year alone and have had to be told to keep the fact we bought them a secret so that no one in Susan’s side of the family become jealous and act out.

We don't want to just give up on him either, especially because of how his behavior influences his sister but we are struggling to reach him, we are struggling to support my sister whose own issues also need work but we want to walk into this meeting with productive ideas on how to effectively help them.

Any advice on this situation is greatly appreciated. Also, thank you for reading this wall of text!

Right at midnight, I woke up to her crying and coughing up hard, so I turned on the light and she said she didn't feel good, and threw up on her hand. She hasn't shown any signs of being sick all day, and in fact, she's been pretty active all weekend, from last night's concert/block party to when we went to the neighborhood park at about 5:30 this afternoon, to when she was watching YouTube music videos on my PlayStation and dancing earlier tonight until 10:00pm.

To treat this, I wanted to give her a can of Canada Dry, but I didn't have any so what I did was give here a Honey Lemon Halls (which admittedly was kinda sticky from being in my backpack for a few weeks) to calm her throat down so she's not coughing so hard and causes her to puke again, and a coffee cup filled with filtered spring water from our cooler, put the trash can by the couch where she's sleeping, and turn on the TV to SpongeBob to keep her awake while she finishes the Halls. Now that that's done, I've put her back to sleep on the couch with the trash can and cup of water nearby.

Is there anything else I should try to help treat/cure her sickness, so she's back into tip-top shape? She had shave ice (aka a snow cone), a few granola energy bars, a musubi (sushi with just spam), and a hot pocket last night, and today she had saimin (shrimp-flavor ramen), CapriSun, and rice with barbecue steak, Portuguese sausage &amp; canned corn for dinner.

I am hoping you can give me some advice on how to help someone in this situation. I made a throwaway to post as I dont want to inadvertently embarrass anyone and make matters worse for my friend. I am asking for advice for her because I don't know what to say or do. I don't have children and have no experience with them. 

Background:

My friend left her husband two years ago due to the way he treated her. He never hit or screamed at her, but he constantly made her feel like she didn't matter. Everything had to be his way and there was no room for compromise, even down to what they ate. She tried very hard to save her marriage as she was head over heels in love with him and didn't want it to go down this road, but he is a very emotionless, bitter person and it seems like he isn't happy unless he's mad at the world. I've never talked to him about his side or why he is like that, so I can't comment on that (so obviously this part of the story is one-sided.) They have a son together who is 11. She is also pregnant and due any day. 

The situation: 

She met a man shortly after she left her husband and they have since developed a relationship (he is the father of the baby she is pregnant with.) He does not live on the same continent as us and so she travels a couple of times a year to see him. He cannot come here easily and so she must do the traveling. They are planning to marry soon. Neither the ex or her son know about their plan to marry as she is worried the problems she is already having with her son will be exacerbated. 

Her son is not happy about the new relationship. He has made comments, albeit only twice, about hurting the baby. He has gone to see the fiance a couple of times and was very difficult with them both while he was there. He acts like the fiance doesn't exist when he tries to interact with him. 

Her son is having many emotional problems. He gets angry if she interacts with other people. He blames her for the divorce because she was the one that made the decision. They had to move, he had to change schools and his pets were given away because the ex refused to have them around after the divorce (she would have taken the pets, but they were given away before she could interject.) The kids at the new school bullied him badly. He often makes very vindictive comments toward her in the same manner her ex does and it is really wearing on her. She and her ex speak frequently about their son and parenting/plans and, although he belittles her, she does not want to hurt him. The ex also blames her for the way their son is acting. He says that she speaks to her fiance too much and that their son is behaving this way because of that. I think it's an accumulation of everything that has happened to him in the last couple of years, but as I said I don't know anything about kids. He seems angry because he is unhappy and that's totally understandable, he's been through a lot and he is still young. 

The other issue is that she is very very lenient with her son and it is obviously becoming a problem. There are things he says and does that really should NOT be let go, but she doesn't say anything to him. She says it's because it will be a fight and he is already angry with her, she doesnt want to make it worse. Her ex has also told her that she needs to ""be a parent"" and stop letting him get away with the things he does, I agreed with this when she told me, I dont know if I was wrong to do so. 

She wants to take her new baby to meet her father after she is born. She plans to marry him at this time too. She feels that, with the way her son feels about the fiance and baby, he will be emotionally damaged from witnessing this trip (fiance will be happy to see the baby, wanting to spend time with her, then of course the marriage will obviously upset him.) Her ex is insisting that she takes him and says that if she doesn't, then she is being a bad mother and it will psychologically hurt their son. 

Advice:

What advice can I give her on how to help her son?

Do any of you feel that it is beneficial for her son to go on this trip (instead of the next one) or is she right to feel it would be detrimental for him?

Is it better to not discipline him when his behaviour is over the line since he is already angry with her? Or is that creating more problems?

Are there ways to make her getting married and having a new baby easier for her son given that the son doesn't want anything to do with them?

How can she help him to stop blaming her for the entirety of the relationship demise?

Sorry in advance for any mistakes. I'm a mess right now.

Has anyone here ever had their child/teenager admitted to an adolescent psych unit?! 

I'm kinda breaking down here and don't know what to do or where to turn!! I have 4 kids who are preteens/teen. My only son is 15. I've known for a while that he had some anger issues and would let feeling build up and up until he would just snap. Until recently he was never violent towards anyone, it was always just throwing something or maybe hitting a wall. But last week, his 11 year old sister was goofing around after dinner and threw a piece of watermelon at him. Next thing I know, he has her in a choke hold and I had to physically pull him off of her... 

After things settled down and I made sure my daughter was okay, me and him sat down and had a long talk. He told me alot about how he was feeling and about a few things I didn't know was going on. Mainly that the bullying at school had gotten worse this year and that he was scared of going to school. I kept him home for a few days and am dealing with that with the school. But I also decided that he might benefit from some counseling and sat up an intake appointment with the same facility ny daughter goes to for depression... That appointment was this morning. During his intake interview, he told them that yeah, he has thoughts of hurting people, especially people who do stuff to him, and that he would kill them if he could. Well, obviously that escalated thing fairly quickly and they sent us to do a risk assessment with another place..... and by the end of the day, he was admitted for inpatient treatment.  

I had my heart ripped out and crushed to pieces!! I had to watch my baby boy (yes, he's 15 but all of us moms know how that goes) sit and cry to me asking me not to leave him there and there wasn't a damn thing I could do!!! 99% of the time, this is one of the sweetest kids you could ask for!! He's shy and quiet but loves with all his heart and will do anything for anyone. Yes, he has some issues but, honestly, who doesn't at some point... Anyways, a nurse and I finally talked him into giving it this evening and tonight and see how things were tomorrow when I can go visit. He thinks he's coming home tho and I know good and well they're not releasing him that quickly. They said it's usually 3-5 days. I know that isn't long but it doesn't feel like it right now...

Anyways, just wondering if anyone here can possibly give me any insight, advice, anything?!?! I'm feeling like such a failure as a parent right now and keep asking myself if it really needed to come to all this... but then again, I know if he'd hurt one of his sisters again that I'd never forgive myself for thinking I could handle things. I'm just so lost! I want my boy to get better but I'm afraid he's gonna come home hating me for it too.

Background: I (27 F) welcomed my daughter In August and whilst it’s been highs, lows, in betweens of new and first time motherhood I am in a reflective and genuinely curious frame of mind.

My mother passed away when I was 18 months and so have no recollections or memories of my own only through others memories. My father remarried and my step-mother for all the challenges/issues we have had has come to be the woman I will always think of and love as Mom.

Still the bond and longing of blood is strong I suppose, there are times I look at my baby girl and am confronted with the feelings and crisis’ of identity, the absence/ghost of my mother/ birth mother (BM) In addition to this, practically living the theory of family’s tend to replicate themselves: I met and married a man whilst traveling as did BM, I too have relocated for love, my career path unwittingly turned out similar to BM and so forth...there are times contemplating mortality I am haunted that my darling little girl too will know the pain of an absent mother/stranger. Naturally these are things I have to and am working through for myself and now my daughter ( put on your own oxygen mask before helping others right)

I went to Iceland for a trip. There were 4 people, me, my dad, my cousin, and my aunt.  So I get into the car my cousin rented and then my dad starts screaming at me to apologize. I didn't know what I did wrong.

He drags me out of the car and puts my backpack on the street. Then he takes out my phone (which had my airplane tickets) and he also takes out my computer. He leaves me with my passport and my suitcase is still in the trunk. I sat out on the street while my dad, cousin and aunt get back into the car. They only told him to stop but stood by and watched.

After all that drama, my dad tells me to get back and calls me a crybaby because I was balling my eyes out.

At the airport, my dad forgot about the whole thing and cracked jokes and laughed.

Turns out, I slammed the car door.

My dad still doesn't want a therapist. I brought it up, he is denying that we have a problem.

**Background Info:**

I am a divorced father of a six-year-old girl who is the light and love of my life. Her mom and I divorced when she was two-and-a-half years old. Mom moved 100 miles away, and after a few months of intense depression because of the separation from my kiddo, I followed. Now we share 50/50 custody. It's not a contentious situation with Mom. Maybe a year ago Mom moved in with her boyfriend and his eight-year-old daughter. They're very nice people, and seem to genuinely care for my daughter.

**The Problem:**

When it's me and my daughter, things are awesome. She listens, she's very well behaved, she hugs and talks to her grandparents (we live together). We go on adventures, make art, read, and basically have a fantastic time being together. As soon as Mom comes around, she morphs into a completely different child. She won't listen, she ignores her grandparents, she won't show affection towards them (and it's very toned down with me). She acts like none of the normal rules apply.

The behavior when she's with her Mom alone seems to be the same... they fight with each other, my daughter yells and behaves in ways that, frankly, I never see. When I say she's like a different child, I really mean it. If she didn't look like my little girl, I'd believe it *is* a different child. There are behaviors at Mom's house that have *never* happened here.

She just started kindergarten this year, but this issue has been going on for a while now. Mom and I are very different people. I *try* to channel Mr. Rogers, and she's a bit more edgy than that. I don't know if edgy is the right word, but she's definitely got a different parenting style. I like to spend a lot of one-on-one time with my daughter, while Mom's happy to send her upstairs to play with her almost-step-sister.

I also notice that she seems to share things with Mom more readily than she does with me (I think, sometimes it's hard to tell what's real and what a kid's being led to). For instance, when preschool was coming to an end (she started kindergarten this year) she told Mom she was bored. She wouldn't tell me that even when I flat out asked her. I kept at it a bit and she finally told me they do a lot of the same things every day and she wants to do more. I don't know why she wouldn't just tell me, because we've promised each other many times to always be honest about our feelings.

Is she acting crazy with Mom to get more attention? Is she mirroring our personalities and when we're together mirroring the dominant personality (that's Mom, for sure). I was thinking about having a chat with my daughter about it, and seeing if she can articulate why she's so different when Mom is around and if there's something we can do to help her out. Is that a bad idea?

I hope this doesn't come across as critical to Mom, because I'm not trying to be. We're different, for sure, but we both love our daughter tons.

TL;DR: Mom and I are divorced and my daughter is two different children - one with me and one with Mom present. What do?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Parents,&lt;/p&gt;

My dad threatened to ground me for that little feud. A recent time I was grounded was because I refused to go with my mother to the airport. Hear me out: I was super behind on a school project and I couldn't work without index cards. I was usually punished for not voluenteering to go to my mother's apartment, which meant 3 or 4 hours sliced from my only day to play. My mother voluenteered to get the cards, but she would take all day and I wouldn't be able to work until tommorow. My dad on the other hand, could drive with me to office depot and be back in 20 to 30 minuets. I begged my dad to go, but he said that he wanted to stay at home and enjoy his video game. This ticked me off because whenever I didn't want to go to the apartment, he said that the weekend wasn't all about me and my video game. Now I would have to wait 5 hours for mom to get home instead of just driving 20 minuets to office depot. Also my father grounded me for not going with my mother and trying to go with him. I waited all day and my mom cane home at 6pm. She got the wrong cards. I cried. (Yeah, I'm a baby) my dad got all up in my face about how I should have gone with mom. Then mom comes around the corner and starts hitting me with a sandal mid sentence. This pushes me over the edge and I told her that she should join a talent show because of her amazing ability to screw everything up. My dad then holds off against the wall by my neck and screams about how I should not talk to my mother like that. (I shouldn't have said that, but he should have also just taken me to office depot) I then lose video games for the rest of the weekend, and I spent all day doing my assignment. My parents also didn't like it when me and my brother would play alot on Sunday, but it was our only time all week to play, so naturally, we crammed long hours of play into Sunday. I tried to make a deal with my parents that if I got all A's on my report card, then I could play for 1-2 hours on Monday's, Wednesdays, and Fridays. They said no, which I thought was unreasonable. I also had to have all A's and B's in order to play normally. So when I worked hard all week to have good grades and the  have my reward taken away because I wanted to enjoy it, I felt cheated. I was in no way, a bad kid. I usually followed the rules of my household, although I viewed then as quite strict, seeing as there was a 3rd grader next door who was allowed to stay up longer than I can. There was a new update on my game, so I logged on, checked out the update for 4 or 5 minuets, and logged off. My brother had come home with an attitude and saw me on, so he called my dad and told him. My brother says he expected my dad to ground me for a day or so, because that's the type of treatment he usually receives. My dad came home, and without saying a word to me, ripped my PS4 out of its sockets so hard, it broke a peice off of some of my equipment and might have bent a port or cable. He then proceeds to walk downstairs into the garage and pretends to throw it away. He didn't, but he pretended to. That was just mean. He really could have just calmy took my pS4 and left. But no. He had to rip it out with the force of God himself. He also said I wouldn't be able to go out with my friend's on the day my birthday was supposed to be celebrated, and that I couldn't go to my friends birthday party, witch was the day after mine. He told me that i couldn't get anything gaming involved, which crossed out 80 % of all things I wanted. My birthday is ruined and my Playsation was violently ripped from its cables because I logged on to check an update for 5 minuets. Even my little brother said that he would have just been grounded Friday night. Not even a whole day. I'm grounded for at least 2 to 3 weeks including my birthday. This pisses me off so much. I try to explain to my dad what happened, but he didn't let me. I wanted to have a conversation about it, but he threatened to raise the punishment. I then go to my room and cry for 2 hours. All while calling my brother names through the wall. My parents then come into my room and tell me that they sat on the other side of the wall to hear me cry. They acted like they were so smart. I cried even harder, but this time, with no words. I didn't want the 2 FBI agents listening in on my thoughts. Now I couldn't even vent my anger through words. I was forced to bottle it up and not express it in any way.  My dad also is very narsisitic, and must win every argument. I was arguing with him about school curriculum and brought up the fact that I was a student and he wasn't, and he says, and I quote, "" You never stop being a student. You're a student of life.""

My husband has moved out, he purchased a home near the middle school with the thought that our son will walk to his house after school vs taking the bus to my home.

Prior to his dad moving out our son hated his dad because he thinks he is inconsiderate (bought a dog without discussing the age and breed with the family), lectured the family about commitment but moved out and is seeking a divorce, and he thinks his dad is racist (I am black and his dad is white and from Holland and the Dutch has a very racist practice during Xmas called Swarte Piet-they dress up in black face).

I have negotiated with my son to go over his dad's house after school one day a week for a few hours and his dad takes him to basketball practice four times a week.

To be honest ,I feel sorry for my soon-to-be-ex-husband, but I really don't care if he has a good relationship with his son. Although I try to foster one as much as possible without alienating my child by forcing him to spend more time than he wants to with his dad.

I kindly ask him to not instill hatred for others in my niece, but unfortunately her mother holds similar beliefs so I can only do so much.

I don’t really understand why I don’t, and never have, had any warm fuzzy feelings surrounding the idea of being a mother.

I feel she really did try but sometimes I wondered if it was slightly more important to her that she at least simply appear to be a good mom to the outside world because she could always keep it together in public but never behind closed doors.

Screaming, crying, breaking my nice sh^t. Dealing with guilt from judge mental parents. I mean, I guess having a kid might be bearable if they were at least well behaved or grateful but most kids don’t seem to be.

I thought the letter would spur them to help him more or even spend time with him while he was working on school work. Nothings changed. It's still wake up iPad, go to school and come home to the iPad while they do other things. 

Since I understand that they work and want to relax when they get home, I want to offer to help. But in the past my step mom has come across as resentful when I go beyond to play or interact with my brother. I believe it to be jealousy. It could all be in my head. She tells me often that she appreciates my interest in still being a sibling to my brother with such a large gap. But in the moment it never seems that way. 

I don't know how to bring it up, I tend to be a blunt person and I know sometimes it can come off entitled or rude. I just really want the best for my brother. I know he doesn't have a learning disability, hes very caring and intelligent. But no one has ever showed him work ethic. They allow him to be on he iPad on the couch anytime hes home.

&lt;p&gt;I thought the letter would spur them to help him more or even spend time with him while he was working on school work. Nothings changed. It&amp;#39;s still wake up iPad, go to school and come home to the iPad while they do other things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I understand that they work and want to relax when they get home, I want to offer to help. But in the past my step mom has come across as resentful when I go beyond to play or interact with my brother. I believe it to be jealousy. It could all be in my head. She tells me often that she appreciates my interest in still being a sibling to my brother with such a large gap. But in the moment it never seems that way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to bring it up, I tend to be a blunt person and I know sometimes it can come off entitled or rude. I just really want the best for my brother. I know he doesn&amp;#39;t have a learning disability, hes very caring and intelligent. But no one has ever showed him work ethic. They allow him to be on he iPad on the couch anytime hes home. (I&amp;#39;m talking screen time 6+ hours on weekdays, and even more on the weekends) I don&amp;#39;t want to overstep or try to parent him without talking to them first. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would ya&amp;#39;ll go about this? Any advice is greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

My husband and I are below average in the looks department. We love each other and we're really happy together, best friends and all that, but we know neither of us is going to be strutting down the runway anytime soon. We have a biological son who looks like us. We think he's adorable, but objectively, he's an average looking kid. He doesn't get much attention in public, and we thought that was normal. 

But our daughter. She's legit a gorgeous child. Having her as a baby was completely different from my son. I got stopped on every aisle of the grocery store. Every outing, multiple people would stop and fawn over her. As a baby, it was fine. She didn't know, enjoyed the attention, etc. Big brother was a toddler and didn't care either. I took her to a popular photography studio to have six month photos taken and the asked to use her photos for promotional purposes. I thought, okay, cute baby but she'll hit that awkward toddler phase and some of this hubub will die down. 

Nope. It got a billion times worse because we moved out of the US to a foreign country. Now she's like a little celebrity. We have attracted a small mob before. Every outing, complete strangers start recording her and taking her picture. Sometimes they ask, but usually they don't. I'm protective of my children, but I don't hold their hand constantly. I usually give my kids space to walk for themselves on escalators and such, because, well, they're 3 and 4 now and they can walk by themselves. But people freak out if I let her do anything. God forbid she falls. People come running. I get scolded for letting her do things on her own by older women. We had a stranger - a mother - take her away from us on the beach to go take pictures of her. I was in the surf with my son, maybe 8 feet away? She was playing in the sand with shells and her little bucket. This lady just came and picked her up off our beach blanket. My daughter started crying for me, and I came running, but the lady just took pictures with my kid screaming her head off until I literally grabbed her out of the lady's arms. It's happened other times, too. I've been told it's a common thing in this particular culture. She's been grabbed like 3 times now? Obviously we're quick to grab her back, and it's always mothers with their own children in tow, but it's upsetting. 

Now my once outgoing kid is understandably terrified of strangers. She has developed a sixth sense for someone trying to snap her picture and goes running to the stroller, or buries her face in a stuffed animal. Other mothers will come up and say (IN FRONT OF THEIR OWN DAUGHTERS) that she is the sort of child they wished they had. Wherever we go, she is called ""little doll,"" ""beauty,"" ""Barbie baby."" She gets angry and tells me that's not her name. 

I am, of course, being more protective. I stay within arm's reach now. At first I was very polite to people asking for her picture, but now I'm curt and say, ""No, she doesn't like it."" But I don't know how to handle this. Is there anything different I can be doing? I keep both my kids in pretty cute clothes, but I've contemplated dressing her more plainly or pulling her hair back. My son has started to notice all the attention she gets, and has even started telling people ""That's my sister, she's shy. I'll talk to you."" But they just ignore him. 

So super hot moms who have gorgeous children, or grew up being treated the way my daughter is being treated, or siblings who looked very different from each other...what should I do? What can I do? I'm trying to praise her for being kind/smart/funny, and not emphasizing the looks. I'm doing my best to protect her in public and tell people to give her space, but I'm worried all the picture taking and recording and, for lack of a better description, kid cat-calling, is harming her and starting to change her personality.

I [20 F] have a little brother [16 M] who has been in a lot of trouble recently and my parents have been less than willing to help him or themselves in the situation. Im not sure what to do, and I'd like to know what you think I should. Here's the story. It's a long one.

It really picked up around two years ago, but he has always had anger issues. It has progressively gotten worse. 

Firstly, about 2 years ago, my brother stole some electronics from a store while shopping with my mom and got caught by police. My mom proceeded to take him home (after being banned from the store and having a long talk with the police) and grounded him from everything a boy has to lose. This led to a complete angry breakdown from him, where he basically blamed my mother for him being this way, telling her she has no idea who he is or what he's going through. Like a day later he comes to her all ""boo hoo I'm so sorry, I'm a horrible son how could you ever forgive me, I made a mistake"" and of course he's got all of his things back (too soon in my opinion). 

As time progresses, this happens again and again with different things he's gotten caught with. After stealing from the store, it became a continuous theft from my parents, whether it be typing their credit cards into purchases online or just swiping cash from their wallets. He got caught with this, had the same angry breakdown, blamed my mom for being a bad kid, blamed his life for being so horrible, blamed everything and everyone but himself. Then came crawling to apologize and cry and promise it'll never happen and ""I'm so horrible how could you ever forgive me"" and my mom pitied him and went easy on him (again). (He still steals cash from them to this day.)

Side note, I'd like to point out that we are a moderately wealthy family, and we all are very loving and giving. My parents are wonderful and have never been abusive or bad. I'll also say that every time he has gotten caught for things like this, it is because he came to me to brag about getting away with it, and I told my parents. Im not about to foster that arrogance. I'm not a snitch but...when we are hard on money bc of a buisness problem and he's stealing, or he is putting himself or others in danger..I'm telling.

So next, he was drinking. This starts around him turning 16. He was getting excessively drunk at parties with friends and lying about where he was going...which is something teens do, I get it. But heres the kicker- he would get in the car with his buddies and they would drive around the neighborhood and drink. And he would come to me and brag about getting away with it. Line crossed, parents told. Cue the angry outbreak, and now he's cussing them out, and now he's being a bit threatening, and now he's bigger and stronger than my parents and he knows hes intimidating. Grounded from everything, and next comes the sob story and the promises to never drink again and the quick forgiveness and everything back to normal.

Next, vaping. Ugh. Just ugh. Grow up.

Next, weed. Now that one broke my mother's heart. She is...extremely against weed. This one I didn't tell...I don't really care. But she caught him. He was smoking a dab pen IN THE HOUSE how arrogant and overconfident can you be...anyways. The weed didn't bother me. The angry blame game that happens after did. Same story, over and over. Just a little worse, a little further each time. Only this time my mom stuck to the consequences a lot better. (She is SO against weed)

Now since the weed incident, he has been a perfect angel. Seemingly turned it around. Got new friends. Seemed like better influences. Got his first serious girlfriend who he seems to really care for. Who seemed to be a good influence....

So my mom finds out (from my older brother this time...his wife was staying with us bc of buisness and she caught him and was uncomfortable keeping that secret) that my little brother has been sneaking his gf in (she lives down the street) a few nights a week to sleep over. And they smoke weed in his room. While my parents are home. Having sex up in his room with no protection (which he bragged to me about.) This girl is SIXTEEN. I am NOT having a 16yo dad as a brother. I am not letting my brother ruin this girls life having a kid at 16. Nope.

Anyways. They find out. Cue the worst angry freakout to date. (Another side note. I'm in college. I'm not home during this. This is the story from my parents)

They confront my brother. Haven't even gotten to the ""you're grounded"" part. They're on the ""we thought we raised you better"" ""how could you"" ""this is so violating"" part. He rushes to the kitchen, grabs his newly recieved truck keys and his phone off the counter, and runs for the door. In the truck, peels out, flipping them off all the way, gone. My mom calls him. He says ""you will never see me again. I'm fucking gone, I'm out of here, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you."" Mom said ""get back here in 15 or we are reporting the truck stolen.""
15 minutes pass, he pulls up, calls. 
""Get the fuck out here. You want to talk, come out. I am not coming inside.""
Mom says no. Calm down and come inside. 
He does. (Save the calm part)

He comes into the house..walks into the living room where my parents are sitting on the couch. Starts yelling, blaming them, accusing them of loving him less than his siblings, accusing them of making him this way, ect ect. Then he starts threatening them. 
""You are NOT going to like what happens next..you are not going to like what's about to happen. You better look out"" my mom is freaking out. Asking what he plans on doing. (She told me later she was afraid for her life. Didnt know if he had a knife or something.) So he narrows his eyes, walks right up to my dad..now my dad is sitting on the couch on his iPAD, trying to avoid confrontation, because he knows if he reacts my brother is just LOOKING for a reason to be physical. 

Welp. My brother grabs the IPAD and throws it. Dad stands- brother bends him forward and puts him in a sort of arm bar. (My dad is 61. He has heart problems) So he's struggling and yelling at my mom to run outside and call the police. She does, taking little brother's keys and phone with her. She throws those into the bushes outside to hide them so he can't run again and calls 911. Then my brother lets go and bolts for the front door. My dad gets there first and blocks it, fearing he will hurt my mom. Brother repeatedly shoves dad against the door, eventually causing my dad to scrape the metal part and cut his hand open...uh oh. Brother then runs upstairs and comes back down with ...a fresh cut on his hand??? (I am so angry. Mom suspects he cut it himself to aid in what happens next.)

The police arrive. Get them all separated. Parents inside, brother out. Parents explain the situation. Meanwhile, brother is telling the cops mom and dad are abusive. Just look at the cut on my hand. They're horrible, you have no idea, blah blah. The police take my parents side, ask if they want to press charges and take him to jail for the night. Dad says no. Brother stays home. He is grounded from everything. 

And that's where we are. It's been about a week. My brother has two moods now- silent and defiant. Asshole and nonexistent. He is either sleeping in his room all day or has an attitude. He did his sob story the day after but it...nothing has changed. And I... I am angry. I am living at home so I'm constantly around it. My mother..is so soft. She gives him his TV remote at night. She drove him to lunch the other day. She is sad he isn't talking to her. She believes she's at fault. And she won't send him away somewhere like I suggest (juvy, detention center, whatever). He refuses to go to counseling or therapy.
 My parents have no authority anymore. It's sad and I am so angry and I don't know what to do. I can't stand being around this situation. I want to knock my brother clean across the room and I want to protect my parents from his physical and emotional manipulation. My dad is more on my side... and is very unforgiving about this. But he is a pushover when it comes to my mom. She makes the calls. She pities him and caters to him and does everything to try to get him to talk to her and interact and its driving me inside. He is manipulating her and she cant see it no matter now much I tell her. ""No, he's so remorseful, he feels so bad, he's lost everything"". Whatever. I don't trust him...anyways.

I&amp;#39;m fucking gone, I&amp;#39;m out of here, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.&amp;quot; Mom said &amp;quot;get back here in 15 or we are reporting the truck stolen.&amp;quot;
15 minutes pass, he pulls up, calls. 
&amp;quot;Get the fuck out here. You want to talk, come out. I am not coming inside.&amp;quot;
Mom says no. Calm down and come inside. 
He does. (Save the calm part)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He comes into the house..walks into the living room where my parents are sitting on the couch. Starts yelling, blaming them, accusing them of loving him less than his siblings, accusing them of making him this way, ect ect. Then he starts threatening them. 
&amp;quot;You are NOT going to like what happens next..you are not going to like what&amp;#39;s about to happen. You better look out&amp;quot; my mom is freaking out. Asking what he plans on doing. (She told me later she was afraid for her life. Didnt know if he had a knife or something.) So he narrows his eyes, walks right up to my dad..now my dad is sitting on the couch on his iPAD, trying to avoid confrontation, because he knows if he reacts my brother is just LOOKING for a reason to be physical. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welp. My brother grabs the IPAD and throws it. Dad stands- brother bends him forward and puts him in a sort of arm bar. (My dad is 61. He has heart problems) So he&amp;#39;s struggling and yelling at my mom to run outside and call the police. She does, taking little brother&amp;#39;s keys and phone with her. She throws those into the bushes outside to hide them so he can&amp;#39;t run again and calls 911. Then my brother lets go and bolts for the front door. My dad gets there first and blocks it, fearing he will hurt my mom. Brother repeatedly shoves dad against the door, eventually causing my dad to scrape the metal part and cut his hand open...uh oh. Brother then runs upstairs and comes back down with ...a fresh cut on his hand??? (I am so angry. Mom suspects he cut it himself to aid in what happens next.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police arrive. Get them all separated. Parents inside, brother out. Parents explain the situation. Meanwhile, brother is telling the cops mom and dad are abusive. Just look at the cut on my hand. They&amp;#39;re horrible, you have no idea, blah blah. The police take my parents side, ask if they want to press charges and take him to jail for the night. Dad says no. Brother stays home. He is grounded from everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s where we are. It&amp;#39;s been about a week. My brother has two moods now- silent and defiant. Asshole and nonexistent. He is either sleeping in his room all day or has an attitude. He did his sob story the day after but it...nothing has changed. And I... I am angry. I am living at home so I&amp;#39;m constantly around it. My mother..is so soft. She gives him his TV remote at night. She drove him to lunch the other day. She is sad he isn&amp;#39;t talking to her. She believes she&amp;#39;s at fault. And she won&amp;#39;t send him away somewhere like I suggest (juvy, detention center, whatever). He refuses to go to counseling or therapy.
 My parents have no authority anymore. It&amp;#39;s sad and I am so angry and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I can&amp;#39;t stand being around this situation. I want to knock my brother clean across the room and I want to protect my parents from his physical and emotional manipulation. My dad is more on my side... and is very unforgiving about this. But he is a pushover when it comes to my mom. She makes the calls. She pities him and caters to him and does everything to try to get him to talk to her and interact and its driving me inside. He is manipulating her and she cant see it no matter now much I tell her. &amp;quot;No, he&amp;#39;s so remorseful, he feels so bad, he&amp;#39;s lost everything&amp;quot;. Whatever. I don&amp;#39;t trust him...anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help?&lt;/p&gt;

So my parents have never been the best, they never hit me or physically hurt me intentionally, but they were never really the ""loving parents"" type of people.

My father has been emotionally distant for as long as I can really remember, and my mother is strict, like really strict. 

She used to scan/go through my phone almost weekly and was more of this person I had to live with than a mother. She always knew exactly what to say and more than once did I break down crying in font of her after she broke down all my walls. Obviously my feelings always got dismissed after she got what she wanted.

I remember several occasions where all my electronic devices and internet connection would be taken away for weeks when I did thing she didn't like. I was constantly monitored and guilt tripped into situations. I was (and to some degree still am) scared of her.

She was even worse on my siblings and took away my sisters door once. And because of this I hardly know them, I have been working of me and my brothers realationship, but I can't really figure out the rest.

And for as long as I can remember I would dream of moving out/running away/get taken away or just be born I a different family, and that apparently isn't something all kids dream of.

But suddenly she changed, she started trying and for real this time. I am grateful, and I know that there are people who have it so much worse, but it doesn't all just go away.

I'm still scared and uncomfortable and I kind of hate myself for it sometimes, but she talks to me like im a toddler, and it makes me feel so stupid.

I'm sorry if this came off as really bratty and like im complaining, but I'm confused, what should I do? And how do I fix a realationship that I never had?

&lt;p&gt;She was even worse on my siblings and took away my sisters door once. And because of this I hardly know them, I have been working of me and my brothers realationship, but I can&amp;#39;t really figure out the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for as long as I can remember I would dream of moving out/running away/get taken away or just be born I a different family, and that apparently isn&amp;#39;t something all kids dream of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But suddenly she changed, she started trying and for real this time. I am grateful, and I know that there are people who have it so much worse, but it doesn&amp;#39;t all just go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still scared and uncomfortable and I kind of hate myself for it sometimes, but she talks to me like im a toddler, and it makes me feel so stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry if this came off as really bratty and like im complaining, but I&amp;#39;m confused, what should I do? And how do I fix a realationship that I never had?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely, a confused kid&lt;/p&gt;

Another friend and her husband are obsessed with Halloween and scary movies. Their 5 yr old also ""loves"" Halloween and scary movies. They couldn't be more proud.

A friend who is in a rock band and exclusively listens to punk, and other sub genres of rock. His 4 yr old has a mowhawk and ""loves"" rocking out with dad. Awesome!

I have 2 friends that are both high school art teachers and their 5 yr old loves drawing (kinda weak example, since most kids love drawing, but this kid is especially creative and has all the art supplies at home that anyone could think of).

I need some advice. (long read) (Sorry)

&amp;#x200B;

My mom left us when I was around 5. I resent her. My dad was always at work so I didn't get a lot of time with him. He was also depressed about losing his wife so we didn't get a chance at any kind of bonding. My dad remarried eventually.

My step mom treated me and my brother unfairly. She admits it. My step mom has this negative ""thing"" towards me which she agreed to be true at one point. Like, she has harsher reactions to my mistakes and questions. I am 26 and I recently realized how much my step mom gave me and how much she means to me. Yes she treated me unfairly but she gave me the basic things I needed in life in sense of direction and ethics.

I do a lot for this family. At one point when my dad lost his job I was the one bringing in the income for the whole family for several years. I did not complain one bit because I knew that's what I needed to do. Some examples of how I'm being treated:

1. Everybody will have their shoes out by the door. 1 pair of my shoes will be there and 1 pair of my flip flops which someone else took will be there too. Guess who gets yelled at for the mess. I have 2 brothers that live with me who are completely capable of cleaning up after themselves
2. Everyone will be downstairs watching tv. I will go upstairs and play an online game with the guys. She comes in my room and starts complaining that I'm wasting time playing games AGAIN! (I rarely play games)
3. I do 90% of all grocery shopping for the family. My little brother will request chocolate on the phone when I'm at the store already, AFTER the shopping list is made. I forgot to grab that chocolate because I struggle with my memory and I rely on the shopping list to not forget anything. She will be outraged and send me back to the store because he NEEDS his chocolate

I do struggle with my memory. She knows it. But she does nothing to help me with it. Instead she gets angry when I forget things. I legitimately forget and it's not something I can control. I've tried so many things to help train my memory.

I am not emotionally stable. I overthink EVERYTHING and sometimes I will just have a bad day or just feel down. When she notices she immediately starts ""oh look he is having his mood again."" as if I purposefully decided that I want to go around and ruin everyone's day. Shouldn't parents notice and ask what's wrong? Try to help?

She just assumes that I am upset because she yelled at me for something the other day and refuses to believe otherwise. I've shown her that I want to be close to her. I want to be friends with her so badly and don't know how else to show it without having them think that I'm attracted to her in that way. 

My cousin came over and she shows that side of her to him that I so dearly missed all of my life. When she interacts with him I get this feeling like someone took a dagger and slowly pushes it into my heart. The more I see their interactions with each other the more knives I feel being slowly pushed into my heart. She asks him all of the questions a mom would ask a son; 

1. Whats up?
2. How did it go?
3. Are you feeling better?
4. How's your acne? Let me find something that can help
5. What do you think about this?
6. What's your opinion on this?

And they have a lot of inside jokes and more personalized conversations. She shares so much more with him than she does with me. I tried to be a part of their conversations a few times and I just get ignored. When I'm sick she doesn't offer to help. She just tells me to drink tea or something and won't ask me if i'm feeling better. She will only show concern if I am REALLY sick. Like when I had appendicitis, I was REALLY sick and she actually showed she cared for me. I have sever dandruff and other skin conditions and I feel like I have to face it on my own without a mother's ""concern"". She will never compliment me. Feels like she always puts me down. It feels like any idea that I have is automatically flagged as a stupid idea.

I always try to be considerate by being quite when she is sleeping, cleaning up when I see that she is tired, doing chores that she normally does, make her bed when they ""forget to"". Most I can get is 1 thank you. But she will never do anything like that for me. She will call me downstairs and tell me to take something to my room that I forgot to. She could have brought it to my room because she was going upstairs anyways. 

I get blamed for so much. Sometimes when we have no work, I get blamed for not trying and thinking about where to get work. When somebody makes a mess or does something that she hates, her automatic reaction is to suspect that I did it.

I've tried to talk to them. I've tried to voice my feelings but they always find a way to turn it around to where the problem is with me. I tried to believe them and I tried hard to have friendly and caring interaction with them but eventually it always comes crumbling down to me being depressed and parents being annoyed by my depression. I'm not sure how sever my depression is because I usually just feel numb now. Maybe the sadness never left and it's just my normal mental state.

I'm honestly tired of all of the quarreling. I had nobody to teach me what she expects from me. What life expects from me. I sincerely do want to improve, in every aspect. I want to have better memory, better ideas, better mental health, better physical health, better social health. But I feel that the way she treats me forces me to build a wall around me and I just can't whatsoever improve on anything. I have not improved on anything and she is annoyed and surprised that after all of these years I can't get anything down. She has to control everything. I have noticed that 90% of all of my thoughts are about my relationship with my parents.

I put my family first. I don't care for work, friends, money or anything like I care for a good relationship with her. I can't stop overthinking and stressing about how she treats me. We had a ""cold war"" type of situation recently where I was REALLY down because she was treating me extra harshly and she was REALLY annoyed that I was upset. I was depressed and honestly didn't care about a single thing, not even my life. They were leaving out of town for vacation and I didn't want to go because I didn't want to be around them. I guess she gave in and came up to me and said in a good attitude ""Hey son, so we're leaving. I hope everything will be ok?"". In an instant I teared up and gave her a hug and I told her that I still love her. She said she loves me to.

I've tried telling both parent's about how I feel when she treats my cousin like she loves him and treats me like i'm an employee. Their excuse ""he's a relative. Your mom loves you"". He's a relative so he gets treated normally but I'm your son. Who does so much for you. 

If I was in the position, I would leave them and live on my own without even thinking about it. I have no friends and I am not able to be friends with my parent's (which I want so so much). But If I leave then the family business falls apart and my parents won't be able to survive. My dad has bad health and both parents don't speak well enough english. They won't be able to survive without my help and I can't let them lose the house and everything. I think maybe God put us in this position because we HAVE to change. Otherwise we will fall apart. (i'm christian)

What more can I do as a step son?

All I want, literally, is to be treated like a friend. Like a son. Like I'm on their team. I don't want harsh reactions, harsh answers, harsh life. My life has already been pretty harsh. I know she has that side of her that I feel I need. I've gotten to a point in my life where I no longer feel like things need to change. I know that I can't continue if things don't change. I've already changed a lot. Just for the sake of improving my relationship with my step mom I have changed and she noticed herself. She told others that I am a completely different person. I am trying so hard but they seem unwilling to change or listen to me. What more can I do?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents. I need some advice. (long read) (Sorry)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom left us when I was around 5. I resent her. My dad was always at work so I didn&amp;#39;t get a lot of time with him. He was also depressed about losing his wife so we didn&amp;#39;t get a chance at any kind of bonding. My dad remarried eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My step mom treated me and my brother unfairly. She admits it. My step mom has this negative &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot; towards me which she agreed to be true at one point. Like, she has harsher reactions to my mistakes and questions. I am 26 and I recently realized how much my step mom gave me and how much she means to me. Yes she treated me unfairly but she gave me the basic things I needed in life in sense of direction and ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do a lot for this family. At one point when my dad lost his job I was the one bringing in the income for the whole family for several years. I did not complain one bit because I knew that&amp;#39;s what I needed to do. Some examples of how I&amp;#39;m being treated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everybody will have their shoes out by the door. 1 pair of my shoes will be there and 1 pair of my flip flops which someone else took will be there too. Guess who gets yelled at for the mess. I have 2 brothers that live with me who are completely capable of cleaning up after themselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone will be downstairs watching tv. I will go upstairs and play an online game with the guys. She comes in my room and starts complaining that I&amp;#39;m wasting time playing games AGAIN! (I rarely play games)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do 90% of all grocery shopping for the family. My little brother will request chocolate on the phone when I&amp;#39;m at the store already, AFTER the shopping list is made. I forgot to grab that chocolate because I struggle with my memory and I rely on the shopping list to not forget anything. She will be outraged and send me back to the store because he NEEDS his chocolate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do struggle with my memory. She knows it. But she does nothing to help me with it. Instead she gets angry when I forget things. I legitimately forget and it&amp;#39;s not something I can control. I&amp;#39;ve tried so many things to help train my memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not emotionally stable. I overthink EVERYTHING and sometimes I will just have a bad day or just feel down. When she notices she immediately starts &amp;quot;oh look he is having his mood again.&amp;quot; as if I purposefully decided that I want to go around and ruin everyone&amp;#39;s day. Shouldn&amp;#39;t parents notice and ask what&amp;#39;s wrong? Try to help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She just assumes that I am upset because she yelled at me for something the other day and refuses to believe otherwise. I&amp;#39;ve shown her that I want to be close to her. I want to be friends with her so badly and don&amp;#39;t know how else to show it without having them think that I&amp;#39;m attracted to her in that way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My cousin came over and she shows that side of her to him that I so dearly missed all of my life. When she interacts with him I get this feeling like someone took a dagger and slowly pushes it into my heart. The more I see their interactions with each other the more knives I feel being slowly pushed into my heart. She asks him all of the questions a mom would ask a son; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whats up?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did it go?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you feeling better?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How&amp;#39;s your acne? Let me find something that can help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you think about this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;#39;s your opinion on this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they have a lot of inside jokes and more personalized conversations. She shares so much more with him than she does with me. I tried to be a part of their conversations a few times and I just get ignored. When I&amp;#39;m sick she doesn&amp;#39;t offer to help. She just tells me to drink tea or something and won&amp;#39;t ask me if i&amp;#39;m feeling better. She will only show concern if I am REALLY sick. Like when I had appendicitis, I was REALLY sick and she actually showed she cared for me. I have sever dandruff and other skin conditions and I feel like I have to face it on my own without a mother&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;concern&amp;quot;. She will never compliment me. Feels like she always puts me down. It feels like any idea that I have is automatically flagged as a stupid idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always try to be considerate by being quite when she is sleeping, cleaning up when I see that she is tired, doing chores that she normally does, make her bed when they &amp;quot;forget to&amp;quot;.

I’m a fifteen year old girl, and my mother and I have a generally close relationship. Recently, she made me download a tracker app on my phone (Verizon smart family). This app gives parents access to their child’s location, the ability to view and restrict who they call and text, the ability to stop their internet connection, the ability to view the apps and sites they visit and the ability to place content filters. About a week ago, she made me download this app, which placed a VPN onto my device.

This was a total shock to me, as I like to think I’m a pretty boring kid, and I generally have nothing to hide. So what’s my problem? I feel like this is crossing some boundaries and makes me very uncomfortable. I’ve expressed my concerns to my mom, and she says she just wants me to be safe. I feel as if she doesn’t trust me, yet she insists it’s only for emergencies. I’m okay (only slightly put off) with the location tracking. That’s a compromise I’m willing to make, but I think the rest is a step too far. I suggested that she use Find My iPhone, but she said it’s too unreliable.

A few days ago, she found me crying in my room and I explained it was about her not trusting me (not my proudest moment, but hey it happens). She says she does trust me, but will not allow me to delete the app. It’s her phone, she bought it, it’s her property and she can do whatever she wants with it. 

I don’t know what to do at this point. I feel like talking about it further with her will lead to nowhere. I’ve considered leaving my phone at home and just spending time on the computer, but I really do want to be safe and would like to have it on me in case of emergencies. I really do not believe that she legitimately trusts me. Because I feel like my privacy is being violated, there is definitely a strain on our relationship.

I love my parents dearly and I know we are all at our wits end so I am posting here in hopes that someone with some real-life experience might be able to shed some light on what has worked for them. 

My youngest sister is 11 and still having violent tantrums multiple times a day, typically as a result of not getting what she wants. This can be over seemingly minor things and results in shrieking, screaming, hitting and kicking, yelling insults, throwing things, and the like. These fits can last HOURS. Over the last few years it has seemed to get worse rather than better. Mind you my parents have successfully parented multiple children prior to her, she is not “spoiled” and has not ever gotten her way more than the rest of us. 

Her issues have been brought up to the pediatrician repeatedly over the years and dismissed. A second opinion was received and she did see a child psychologist for a period of time, who diagnosed her with mild autism and sensory-processing disorder. She went to therapy 3x weekly for about 6 months to try to target these issues and give her some coping mechanisms but did not improve whatsoever. She would manipulate the therapist and admit to certain behaviors but blame it on my parents. The psychiatrist she worked with did not believe she was severe enough to need meds.  Our insurance doesn’t cover mental health treatment and since therapy didn’t seem to be making any difference at all, she was removed from the program.

She is now in middle school and still having these meltdowns. She places the blame on everyone else, even for mistakes she makes. She lies through her teeth. Cannot take responsibility for absolutely anything such as chores etc. Tries to bargain about absolutely everything (won’t take a shower unless you let her play video games for another 20 min., etc.). Will scream at bedtime for hours until 3-4 in the morning when my parents need to be up for work at 5 am. 

It’s exhausting for everyone, and like I said it only seems to be getting worse. My mother has openly said that she is tearing my parents marriage apart. She’s been depressed for years and feels like she has failed as a parent. Medical professionals just keep telling her “it will get better eventually” and it never does. I could go on typing for days about all of her behavioral issues but I think the snapshot I provided paints a pretty clear picture.

I have an almost 4yo girl who is a bit more sensitive than usual. And I'm pregnant with another girl; entered the second trimester. 

I wanted to postpone the news for her until it became visible because I didn't want to answer couple million of ""when is the baby coming"" questions. However,  it seems like it is harder to keep it as a secret, especially when my friends and family finally learned it.

My question: I want to do announcement and introduction right. I searched Amazon, but the couple of books I found were not what I was looking for. Do you have any books/sources that helped you with this specific issue. I'm okay with a single chapter in a more comprehensive book too.

I have a 3ds which has mostly all kid friendly games. Point is what should I let him play as he will probably only be in the house TMR for 2 hours before he goes to sleep.

I'm thinking about only letting him touch the DS and my tablet. Like I said 3 minutes I could have basic parental controls so he couldn't go on my Instagram and stuff.

Also at what time does a 6yo get tired around? Knowing my cousin (his mom) she will probably have us home by 10. But will he be tired from all the walking around before 10? We are supposed to do a lot of walking and be out for a lot of hours.

Edit: The app for blocking ig and stuff needed a subscription so I gave up. And I remembered his mom saying he has an iPad. So he will probably just be on his iPad. If he asks ""what's that's or ""can I play on it?' I'll say yes if it's the DS. Until I get a response I'm not sure about the Xbox as I'm afraid he will get mad if he has to get off if I can't be watching him. Only meant him two times in my whole life don't no much about him except he does really good at home and school but thats because he has a very loving and strict mom.

Edit: All went very well. Kid didn't have his ipad but did not ask to play my consoles ONCE. He just watched tv with his mom in the guest bedroom. The kid was still up at 10:30 the 6yo said ""I'm tired"" then 5 minutes later asked to play a board game around 10ish. We all chilled went to the attractions, arcades.

He’s grabbed me by the neck and choked me, slapped me in the back of the head (This has left bruises on the back of my head in the past), and thrown objects at me. He hit me in the face for not doing laundry once. When he’s mad, he’ll also threaten me by saying that he’ll break my jaw or that he’s going to punch me in the face. He’ll also get up in my face and clench his teeth to scare me. I’m physically abused, but I don’t think it’s as bad as my emotional abuse.

Both of my parents can be emotionally abusive. When my dad is upset with me, he’ll keep saying hurtful things to me for like an hour straight, and he won’t stop, he doesn’t even let me cool down. He’ll come in my room and badger me, and he won’t leave, he blocks the doorway. My mom does this too. Both of my parents have called me names such as the r word, worthless, stupid, etc. They know my weaknesses, so they purposely attack me verbally about things that make me sad to put me down. I have Asperger’s (High-Functioning form of Autism) and my dad said that I’ll never have friends because I’m not right in the head, and he also said that I probably have Tourette’s. I have trouble making friends and socializing because of my disability, and my parents both know that I wish I had friends, so that’s why they’re saying that. My dad also says that I should be in a Psych Ward or Autism home, but I’m not even a bad kid. I get straight As, never do any drugs, and don’t go out partying. I’m not some out of control kid. Everyday, there’s arguing or screaming at the top of your lungs, it’s insane. One morning I woke up, and said, “Mom”, and my mom screamed “WHAT?”. I’m not even exaggerating. I also wanted my mom to try a piece of brownie once to make sure it was fully cooked, but she just started screaming and acting psycho. She could’ve just calmly said, “Not right now.” One time, I let my dog in her room by accident, and my mom started flipping out because she hates having the dog in her room. When I wasn’t getting the dog out fast enough, she threw a box of dog treats at me, and hit me in the face. She wouldn’t stop screaming at me. I’m pretty sure my mom is a narcissist too because she acts super nice and fake in public, but acts totally different at home. 

My mom is one of the laziest people ever. She makes her day sound SO busy, but in reality she mostly just sits up in her room all day smoking weed or drinking alcohol. We never spend time together as a family or anything. My parents barely ever leave the house. We’re involved in sports, but I think my mom does it to make herself look good because when my older sister was young, they never cared about sports and they basically had my sister raising us. My mom would spend money on making herself look good instead of us, and my mom always left my sister to take care of us. Recently, they’ve been holding my sister over my head because she’s one of the only family members I have. My parents cut off the rest of my family when I was young, but I don’t know what the rest of those family members were like. My mom says that they were jealous of me and hated me, but it doesn’t make any sense because why would they be jealous of a 5 year old? Something is a little fishy there. My brother is also the favorite, and my parents basically kiss his ass. If my brother hits me in the chest or provokes me, nothing is done about it, but as soon as I do something to him, all h*ll breaks loose. One time my brother destroyed my room, and my dad just sat there laughing with him while I was upset,so I threw a pack of his playing cards, and my dad slapped me in the back of the head, and pinned me up against the wall. Then my dad had the nerve to say that if I would’ve kept my cool, he wouldn’t of done that. BS!!  They just say that to make me feel bad. 

I decided to call CPS on them, but before they came, my parents kept badgering me. They said that I had no empathy, and called me a bunch of names. They kept coming in my room, and wouldn’t leave me alone. My mom said that there was no reason for me to call CPS since I’m not being abused. It was insane... I decided to lie to CPS because I didn’t think that they’d help me in the way I’d want them to. I didn’t want to be placed in foster care, so that’s not an option. My mom basically made herself sound like the BOMB mom when talking to CPS. It’s disgusting. I don’t know what to do because I hate very aspect of my life. My parents barely ever say that they love me or give me hugs, I hate it. Any time I make a bad choice, they put me down instead of supporting me or giving me advice. I mostly hate my life. Most of my family sucks, I have no good friends, and I hate my school. There’s basically nothing good in my life. My parents smother me to no end, and they’re doing it on purpose to make me incompetent. They have a bed timer set on all of my devices to 8 P.M.  I don’t know hat to do anymore, I feel trapped. If I had more friends maybe I could get away, but I have so much trouble making friends. I can’t deal with this behavior anymore.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I might as well start off by saying that my dad can be physically abusive at times.

&lt;p&gt;My mom is one of the laziest people ever. She makes her day sound SO busy, but in reality she mostly just sits up in her room all day smoking weed or drinking alcohol. We never spend time together as a family or anything. My parents barely ever leave the house. We’re involved in sports, but I think my mom does it to make herself look good because when my older sister was young, they never cared about sports and they basically had my sister raising us. My mom would spend money on making herself look good instead of us, and my mom always left my sister to take care of us. Recently, they’ve been holding my sister over my head because she’s one of the only family members I have. My parents cut off the rest of my family when I was young, but I don’t know what the rest of those family members were like. My mom says that they were jealous of me and hated me, but it doesn’t make any sense because why would they be jealous of a 5 year old? Something is a little fishy there. My brother is also the favorite, and my parents basically kiss his ass. If my brother hits me in the chest or provokes me, nothing is done about it, but as soon as I do something to him, all h*ll breaks loose. One time my brother destroyed my room, and my dad just sat there laughing with him while I was upset,so I threw a pack of his playing cards, and my dad slapped me in the back of the head, and pinned me up against the wall. Then my dad had the nerve to say that if I would’ve kept my cool, he wouldn’t of done that. BS!!  They just say that to make me feel bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to call CPS on them, but before they came, my parents kept badgering me. They said that I had no empathy, and called me a bunch of names. They kept coming in my room, and wouldn’t leave me alone. My mom said that there was no reason for me to call CPS since I’m not being abused. It was insane... I decided to lie to CPS because I didn’t think that they’d help me in the way I’d want them to. I didn’t want to be placed in foster care, so that’s not an option. My mom basically made herself sound like the BOMB mom when talking to CPS. It’s disgusting. I don’t know what to do because I hate very aspect of my life. My parents barely ever say that they love me or give me hugs, I hate it. Any time I make a bad choice, they put me down instead of supporting me or giving me advice. I mostly hate my life. Most of my family sucks, I have no good friends, and I hate my school. There’s basically nothing good in my life. My parents smother me to no end, and they’re doing it on purpose to make me incompetent. They have a bed timer set on all of my devices to 8 P.M.  I don’t know hat to do anymore, I feel trapped. If I had more friends maybe I could get away, but I have so much trouble making friends. I can’t deal with this behavior anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

And that doesn't even begin all my reasoning. I also have doubts about the quality of life on this planet with pollution, crazy government shit, dying oceans, limited resources et al.

With that being said, the idea of waiting until after I'm 30 for a family was drilled into me. Because the idea was always so far away, I never really gave it much thought. I figured after I turn 30 at some point I'll meet someone and everything will fall into place. Well, I was in that perfect relationship. He wanted marriage and kids, could provide and told me I didn't have to work if I didn't want to, he treated me like a queen, he was good looking... like literally everything you could ask for in a partner and we split because I couldn't guarantee I'd give him children.

Theoretically, I don't hate the idea of reproducing. Passing on my genetics, having a little me, watching my family grow as I age and all that, but that's just the highlight reel. I look at the trenches of parenting and I just feel like I don't want to sacrifice that much for a child. I also realize that line of thinking might bite me in the ass when I'm older.

I can't put him in clothes because I find it difficult to lift him up to do it and cradle his head at the same time.  I find it difficult to swaddle him because it's never tight enough and then the blanket gets loose and I'm afraid he will smother himself with it.  I find it difficult to change his diaper and wipe him because I feel like I'm hurting him when I push his legs back to wipe the poop off.  I'm also not sure if when I buckle the diaper if i'm doing it wrong and it's hurting him.

When I feed him with a bottle I'm worried about forcing too much formula into his mouth at a time.  I never know when he needs a burp or doesn't need a burp. When I wash his bottle out or binky off, I have no idea if it is sanitized sufficiently.

The list could go on. The sleep deprivation is one thing, but I feel like it would be so much easier if every tiny task wasn't such a monumental challenge for me.

I&amp;#39;m so terrified every time my baby cries because I don&amp;#39;t know how to do anything and I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt him.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picking him up is okay if it&amp;#39;s just in the basic cradle the head in the elbow position.  Anything else seems impossible.  Once I have the baby in one position I find it nearly impossible to change it.  I just can&amp;#39;t master any of the burping positions and the baby just winds up in an awkward, uncomfortable looking slouched position.&lt;/p&gt;

TL;DR - Sister moved out in the middle of the night and it is tearing our family apart 

Basically my sister just turned 18 a week or two ago. My dad was on a business trip and I was at college, so it was just my mom and my sister at home and in the middle of the night last Friday she packed up all her things and moved. By things I all of her clothes and ps4 and what not. I get a call from my distraught mom Saturday morning and she's balling her eyes out and my dad leaves his trip to come home. I couldn't go home till Monday to see my parents.

We come from an Indian family with strict rules growing up, i'm sure most foreign children and families can relate. My parents being first generation immigrants that were both born in India and had an arranged marriage always thought the same for us. Until I was 18 and moved out for a couple days because I got caught partying and wanted to party more (I know very dumb reason). My sister apparently has been talking/dating this guy for 3 years over the phone and lying to the parents to see him in person. She just started college and they both go to the same place, so she moved out with all her stuff and moved in with him. They are both 18 and live with his grandma now. His parents are barely in the picture.

My sister was feeling oppressed at home and she said had depression but is happy now that she is living with him. Her reason for leaving changes from time to time so the whole story does not add up. She at least took her phone with her and still texts and calls them and has even met with them in person. She keeps saying she just needs space and time to think, but my parents can't believe that after 18 years she just leave them so they are wrecked from that. I told my parents to give her space but them being caring ask her what they did wrong, she tells them nothing but just says ""idk"" to most things. We told her that living on your own you have our insurance and phone but when my parents decide enough is enough they might cut her off everything. She said she understands that and their plan is to live off his grandma's checks she gets.

So my parents offered her a solution of getting her an apartment in the next town where my dads works and that she could have all the freedom she wants as long as she tells them whats she doing over a text or call but she even refuses to accept that offer. She wants the guy to stay with her at the apartment, To which both my parents and even I said no because most 18 year olds in a relationship do not move in right away and live together. I offered her a solution saying he can stay some nights but if you are seeing him everyday and are allowed to be with why does it matter if you stay at home or in your own apartment. We have only told close family members and they all try to talk to her and even our close cousins who she really gets along with, and they contact her all nice and normally just to see how she is doing. The real problem comes in where my parents are just emotionally and physically devastated. My mom can't sleep or eat and my dad has had a heart attack in the past and was admitted again today for chest pain. Hopefully it is just stress but when my mom called her to tell her she just said she'll see if she has time to come see him. That really hurt them because my sister was closer to my dad than anyone in the whole family. Then my dads sister called and my sister freaked out on her because she was asking too many question about why she left and stuff and now we are all blocked again. My sister is in a really confusing time in her life and I understand that, she wants to be treated as an adult but at the same time can't handle being treated like an adult.

A part of me wants to sympathize with her but when you see your parents cry and beg for you to just to be in their lives and come back home or at least to an apartment and she shows no emotion, I just can't but help feeling like it is a lost cause. My parents said they're going to give her space and time to think but she keeps switching from wanting to be an adult to a helpless child any time I tell her how bad our parents's are doing. She says that we only care now because she left and she told my dad before about being depressed but never me. My dad did not take it seriously and he knows he messed up now. My parents cried their hearts out to her and apologized for never listening to her or giving her a chance, but they are still loving caring parents; albeit a little strict. All they want is her to be theirs again and she wants freedom and to be with him.

The only solution I see is that they completely cut her off and let her stay with him, this would kill my parents and probably send them spiraling. Or she moves into the apartment and continues being with him but just can't spend the night with him sometimes. She does not want to move back home and no one is forcing her to do that, both my parents have told her she does not have to do that if she feels oppressed there.

Hopefully you guys can give some word of advice or thoughts and answers. Anything really, Thank you","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (22M) am posting this on behalf of my parents, myself, and our family to see if you guys have any good advice or insight.&lt;/p&gt;

my daughter is 7 ½ years old. For 2 years she goes to an introduction-level of our primary school (that's like second class). Next year she will come into the third class of our primary school. School makes her much fun – in contrast with learning.
Everyday she has some duties to do including her homework. For example to read some sentences or do some mental calculation.
Some days she comes home and do all her duties very quick. But sometimes she explodes by simple things. It's so weird for me because I can't get any pattern. Today I fucked her totally up by asking what's the result of 62 + 30...few weeks ago she calculated 16 + 16 in less than a few seconds. End of the calculating story (10 Minutes later): She screams she can't manage this math problem because it is to difficult, jumping and rolling around the floor and bully me up to totally madness. I'm a single mom for approx. 5 years and normally very patient but in this situation its very, very difficult for me to stay cool or calm. Because I can't get her problem: Why it's so fucking difficult to calculate 62 + 30 while 16 +16 isn't????
But it's not only mathematics she could explode every time in every situation without any reason (I think). Last week my boyfriend (she calls him her stepfather) opened the door when she comes from school and she screamed immediately why he not open immediately when she rings the doorbell. He stayes cool - every time, in every situation as well she's screaming – and told her that he opened the door immediately but she screamed again “No! I rang the bell ones before!” He answered “Sorry we not heard that the first time” but she ignores him and is pissed of him for hours. When I'm telling her I'm not amused about her reaction she only justify that he hadn't opened the door. What??? Why??? He has apologized! But this doesn't matters for her.
A short notice to the relationship between them: They know each other for 4 ½ years. He has his own apartment with an own room for her although we are rarely in his apartment. Mainly he visits us at my house for the weekend and sometimes during the week. When I have to go for business trips he takes care of her. When they are together without me everything is fine. When he isn't with us my daughter immediately asks where he is, why he's not with us and when he is coming back. When we are all together it's a gambling: Sometimes everything's fine, sometimes she is mainly grouchy with him or me (that's gambling also but more with him than with me). This situation is only since a few month. At the start of the year everything was fine. And I don't know whats happened...We tried to chastise by take away a toy when she screams without any reason (we couldn't get the reason). That helps not. Than we tried to ask for hugs. Seems hugs helps a bit. But today with the mathematics problem I was so mad that I told her going to her room up to she's fine with the situation instead of asking for a hug because I was so full of adrenaline too. A few minutes later she came back very calm to told me the result is 92. 
I'm soo tired of this situations especially my boyfriend is not with us. But he's also tired of this situations because he gets her madness more often than I do. It demoralize us and our partnership. How do you manage that with your kids? And especially: Is it gonna get any better???

Sorry for my bad English I'm not a native speaker.

When I&amp;#39;m telling her I&amp;#39;m not amused about her reaction she only justify that he hadn&amp;#39;t opened the door. What??? Why??? He has apologized! But this doesn&amp;#39;t matters for her.
A short notice to the relationship between them: They know each other for 4 ½ years. He has his own apartment with an own room for her although we are rarely in his apartment. Mainly he visits us at my house for the weekend and sometimes during the week. When I have to go for business trips he takes care of her. When they are together without me everything is fine. When he isn&amp;#39;t with us my daughter immediately asks where he is, why he&amp;#39;s not with us and when he is coming back. When we are all together it&amp;#39;s a gambling: Sometimes everything&amp;#39;s fine, sometimes she is mainly grouchy with him or me (that&amp;#39;s gambling also but more with him than with me). This situation is only since a few month. At the start of the year everything was fine. And I don&amp;#39;t know whats happened...We tried to chastise by take away a toy when she screams without any reason (we couldn&amp;#39;t get the reason). That helps not. Than we tried to ask for hugs. Seems hugs helps a bit. But today with the mathematics problem I was so mad that I told her going to her room up to she&amp;#39;s fine with the situation instead of asking for a hug because I was so full of adrenaline too. A few minutes later she came back very calm to told me the result is 92. 
I&amp;#39;m soo tired of this situations especially my boyfriend is not with us. But he&amp;#39;s also tired of this situations because he gets her madness more often than I do. It demoralize us and our partnership. How do you manage that with your kids? And especially: Is it gonna get any better???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for my bad English I&amp;#39;m not a native speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

I look at it as i&amp;#39;m not just raising children but i&amp;#39;m raising children who will one day be an adult and i want them to be productive members of society. i don&amp;#39;t whip my children and they are not afraid of me they  just respect me and know that if they respect me i will respect them. but anyways its not right to me that this 1 child wants to ,for one upset my grandmother with lies and down grading her or throwing a temper tantrum knowing she has heart problems and doesn&amp;#39;t need the stress and ,for two he has no right to &amp;quot;throw the other kids under the bus&amp;quot; in order to make is hisself look all high and mighty and i truly don&amp;#39;t know why he is even saying these lies bc they are completely irrelevant to what he is wanting us to give in to! please help i am desperate not for myself but for my other children who are getting the shit end of this situation!  he thinks he is grown and refuses to listen or respect me or my grandmother! he is tearing our family apart and causing problems and its not fair to the other children to have to live day by day worrying about if he is going to make a lie up about them today to benefit himself!&lt;/p&gt;

Okay, I need serious advice, I'm an adult survivor of sexual abuse, I was molested as a child by my cousin until I was 6 years old and told my parents (I have no idea when it began, as long as I can remember it was happening).  This post is not about me though, it's about my one year old daughter.  I need serious advice about how to handle this situation and if I'm responding in this way because of my own past or because of actual red flags.

My in-laws watch my 1yr 10 month old every weekend, normally my husband is with them, sometimes he is not.  On Saturday, I picked up my baby in the evening (around 11pm) I picked her up, she was asleep, I went to put her in the carseat to take her home, I was buckling her in and she was crying so hard she almost threw up so my husband and I decided to take her back in and stay the night (we thought she was crying due to being sick) my MIL told me she had been congested/runny nose that evening.

I could not calm my daughter down for at least an hour and a half.  She was crying so hard I couldn't understand a word she was trying to communicate to me and she is normally a very clear speaker.  She was a mess.  Finally I kept asking her questions ""where does it hurt?.."" etc... finally I thought it sounded like she was saying carseat (she has a dolly and a play carseat).  I thought she was referring to that, but I finally kept asking her questions and she was saying she wanted to get back in the carseat to go home.... she definitely wanted to leave.  We put her in the carseat.  She cried uncontrollably on and off for another 20 minutes before falling asleep in the car.

She woke up happy and sweet the next morning, nothing wrong.  I thought she was gassy and that was what was going on?....

Last night though the SAME thing happened.  She fell asleep in the car on the way home after I picked her up.  Seemed grumpy but hadn't taken a nap so I figured just tired and grumpy.  She woke up about halfway through the night again crying uncontrollably.  Same thing.  At least an hour or two of crying, just a complete mess, complained her head was itchy? but didn't seem to be in pain, more in fear but I really couldn't tell.  She would calm down, then start bawling again.  Finally I asked her do you want to ""go sleepy""?  Here's where I'm freaking out guys... she starts screaming ""NO NO NO NO NO NO NO"" Over and over in fear/terror and hugging on me.... which makes me very concerned.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always trusted my in-laws 100%, they give me no reason to believe they'd ever hurt her, however, my brother in law is 22 years old and has always rubbed me the wrong way if I'm being honest.  He is EXTREMELY immature (childlike mentality), and is very friendly with children.  I've always though that he just liked kids and was good with them/because his maturity level is so low, I've excused it, but now I'm FREAKING THE FUCK OUT....so please help me.

I've been sick to my stomach today thinking that my daughter could be being harmed in any way...am I overreacting?  Is this my own past playing into my thoughts?  How would you handle this?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;***TW -- Child sexual abuse **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand this better, you can try it here: &lt;a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1469181486""&gt;Appstore&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.redhotlime.game.keyboard.en""&gt;PlayMarket&lt;/a&gt; (It&amp;#39;s free)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m an indie developer and &lt;strong&gt;greatly appreciate your experience.&lt;/strong&gt; I look forward to your advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, what methods do you usually use?&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve attempted suicide a few times, including earlier today, but I’m always too scared to go through with it. However if I went to a clinic and was euthanised I’d be fine.

I know no parent probably wants their child to tell them they want to die, but I really have lost all hope and this is what want.

I saw a boy emerge from the bushes on the side of the house. I saw a bike tossed on the lawn that definitely wasn’t ours. \n\nMy first thought was it was a burglar casing houses, but since he looked young and came through on a bike, I figured scaring him straight would be enough for him to decide to head home. Didn’t want to ruin a teenager’s life by calling the cops straightaway. \n\nSo I went out on the porch, flipped the lights on, and said “Can I help you?” In my classroom voice. \n\nThe guy looked surprised but not nervous. He was wearing a letterman style jacket, but once I got a clear view of him in the streetlights, he seemed much older than my granddaughter. Gruff. And more wirey than athletic. \n\nHe walked up closer to the house and said “Yah I’m looking for Alyssa.” I gave him a disapproving glare, hoping he’d realize he came looking for a girl late at night and a grumpy old\nperson answered, it’s time to split. \n\nI’m thinking what must’ve happened is Alyssa knew her parents were going out of town and maybe before she knew I’d be staying over told a secret older boyfriend to come over. \n\nIt was late and I was alone with several kids so I didn’t want him coming any closer to the house. I also thought it was weird he came so late and wanted to be sure Alyssa actually wanted to talk to him. So I said “I’m sorry. Who?” And he said Alyssa. You know, Alyssa Lastname.

I saw a boy emerge from the bushes on the side of the house. I saw a bike tossed on the lawn that definitely wasn’t ours. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first thought was it was a burglar casing houses, but since he looked young and came through on a bike, I figured scaring him straight would be enough for him to decide to head home. Didn’t want to ruin a teenager’s life by calling the cops straightaway. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I went out on the porch, flipped the lights on, and said “Can I help you?” In my classroom voice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The guy looked surprised but not nervous. He was wearing a letterman style jacket, but once I got a clear view of him in the streetlights, he seemed much older than my granddaughter. Gruff. And more wirey than athletic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He walked up closer to the house and said “Yah I’m looking for Alyssa.” I gave him a disapproving glare, hoping he’d realize he came looking for a girl late at night and a grumpy old\nperson answered, it’s time to split. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking what must’ve happened is Alyssa knew her parents were going out of town and maybe before she knew I’d be staying over told a secret older boyfriend to come over. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was late and I was alone with several kids so I didn’t want him coming any closer to the house. I also thought it was weird he came so late and wanted to be sure Alyssa actually wanted to talk to him. So I said “I’m sorry. Who?” And he said Alyssa. You know, Alyssa Lastname. This is her house.” I thought, he knew her full name, they must be at least friends. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I said “you wait there.” He started to walk up and I felt a sick burning in my gut.

Let's just say that their home life was not so great, and their mum vanished. The older brother (my best friend) lived with roommates, while Mimi lived with her dad. Andre, Mimi, myself and some other friends have a group chat. 

As Mimi lived several states away from all of us, she would only contact us via chat. She has expressed suicidal tendecies, and would often lie to us about injuries i.e, ""I fell down the stairs"" or ""a classmate gave me a black eye"" or ""I cut ny wrists"" yet on selfies she posted on her Facebook, she shows no signs of said injuries. Yet, some of our friends would give her attention any way. 

This had only gotten worse - she claimed to cough blood and have a heart disease (despite the fact that, as far as I know, coughing blood is a symptom of respiratory system disease) but when Andre questioned their father about it, the dad told Andre it was simply watercolour and that Mimi was not coughing blood at all. Andre has talked to Mimi several times, and she would stop for a while each time before continuing again.

Mimi is still young, and I don't want her to keep lying to gain sympathy and approval. I figured you parents should know best on how to help with a dishonest preteen like this.

Edit : It's not like I'm a saint either, I have lied about curfew, sneaking out and so, and I know I have to fix that about me. But.. I think lying about injuries and self harm is a little bit of an extreme and I'm just really concerned about her.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew Mimi (name changed) because she was my best friend Andre&amp;#39;s little sister. Let&amp;#39;s just say that their home life was not so great, and their mum vanished. The older brother (my best friend) lived with roommates, while Mimi lived with her dad. Andre, Mimi, myself and some other friends have a group chat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Mimi lived several states away from all of us, she would only contact us via chat. She has expressed suicidal tendecies, and would often lie to us about injuries i.e, &amp;quot;I fell down the stairs&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;a classmate gave me a black eye&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I cut ny wrists&amp;quot; yet on selfies she posted on her Facebook, she shows no signs of said injuries. Yet, some of our friends would give her attention any way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This had only gotten worse - she claimed to cough blood and have a heart disease (despite the fact that, as far as I know, coughing blood is a symptom of respiratory system disease) but when Andre questioned their father about it, the dad told Andre it was simply watercolour and that Mimi was not coughing blood at all. Andre has talked to Mimi several times, and she would stop for a while each time before continuing again.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

So a little backstory.  My brother is currently 14, I am 26.  When my brother was born I was essentially a third parent to him (changing diapers, lots of babysitting, spending quality time, and teaching him things).  He was always energetic, excited, funny, and outgoing.  My parents fought a lot during this time so I was always very protective of him and always felt close.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, once middle school started for him, I noticed he definitely started to develop some social anxiety.  I)n elementary school this wasn't the case; he was loud, and had a good amount of friends.)  This, of course, seems normal to me since I have it as well.  However, I noticed, definitely by the end of 8th grade (June of this year), he had really gone south in regards to his social anxiety.  He was completely disengaged from school activities and friends.  

&amp;#x200B;

My parents let my brother have a laptop and a smart phone when by the time he was a bout 10.  I really tried to get them to be strict about screen time, but they essentially let him be on his phone and laptop for as long as he wanted.  Since I am older, I have a life and responsibilities, and wasn't always living at home.  I noticed that at the end of 8th grade, he was almost constantly on his phone and his laptop.  Then, during the summer, my parents just let him stay up in his room pretty much all day every day.  As far as I can tell he was on his phone/laptop all of the time.  His mood was always dour and anytime anyone tried to talk with him he acted like a typical teenager (rolling his eyes, not listening, etc). The only issues is that it was all of the time.  I think over the summer he may have hung out with one of his friends one time.  He doesn't go outside, and he barely eats anything.  If my biology is anything like his, I know that being outdoors greatly increases mood.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway, I was concerned and did some snooping.  I found out he has had a twitter account for about a year (pretty much the same time he seemed to really disengage from the ""real world"") and a discord for I don't know how long.  He had become extremely private about his technology to the point that it reminded me of Gollum and his precious ring.  On his twitter I found out that he has an internet boyfriend that he has never seen or met in person.  Of course a lot of red flags went up for me, but I didn't do anything except tell my mom that he has a twitter account and a discord.

&amp;#x200B;

I suggested they ground him and actually talk to him about what he's doing on the internet and give him some actual screen time limits.  When my mom tried to bring this up with him he just started screaming and yelling.  I saw on his twitter that he felt suicidal. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I did the right thing by tattling on him, but I am just worried about the kid.  My questions are, what can be done at this point?  What can I and my folks do to get him back engaged with the real world and building friendships with other people that he knows?  What is the best way to ween him off of this absolute addiction to technology?

Or, alternatively, am I just out of touch for tattling on him?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: found my kid brother talking online to strangers after about a year of him really disengaging from the ""real"" world.  I am concerned about his mental health and how no outside time and not building real-life friendships is effecting him as a young teen.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR at the end&lt;/p&gt;

About 6 months. 

Started out really well but as time went on, he started to pull away from me. 

He’s a chemical engineering student and I work as a cake decorator; I’m not in classes as of right now. 

Both of us are quite busy. I worked almost 7 hours today; got into work at 12 and, no joke, did not sit down until 6:55 when I got in my car to leave. 

And yet, why is it that only I make time for him? 

If I ask to call him, it’s more likely than not that he won’t answer. If I text him, he won’t answer for hours. I understand in the event of classes or in my case, work but every day? 

I don’t expect to see someone every day, especially not when I live 45 minutes away. I understand that school is difficult. I understand that people have lives outside of me. 

However, I do expect to have at least a little time carved out for me; even if it’s just a phone call every few days or so and texting in between and seeing them once a week. 

But in a time where people our age (both 20) literally must live on their phones and technological devices to do quite a bit I don’t believe that he’s so busy 100% of the time that he can’t even answer a simple message. 

I asked him to call me last night so that I could talk to him about something. I didn’t specify what, but I did term it to where it’s obviously important and something I don’t want to leave alone. 

He acknowledged that, but he was going to bed so I asked if he could call me the next day. (Today) He said he would be free in the afternoon. 

I called him about half an hour after I got off work. 

He didn’t answer the phone. 

The fact of the matter is, that I don’t feel valued. I feel like I’m good for a couple days to chat with and ignore until his friends get busy. I feel like I’m just someone to screw when convenient, and then ignore until he wants to see me again. 

I, like anyone else, have needs. And one of those needs is interaction with people, especially the ones I care about. I don’t want to let this go without at least a conversation of the issue, but I need advice. What would you guys do if your partner was ignoring you?

If anyone has a recipe to make that my kids will eat I’d be really grateful. I’ve searched for recipes online but most of them are with broccoli or dessert type.

Our boy just turned 3.  We also have a 9 month old girl.

We give our boy 3 meals a day with sometimes a snack in the afternoon (if he asks for it).  We had heard that this would encourage him to eat bigger meals, rather than snacking throughout the day on unhealthy snacks, like we see a lot of the other kids doing.  

He eats a decent breakfast and lunch, but almost always, he barely eats his dinner at the table.  Dinnertime is around 6:15.  After picking at his food for 15 minutes, he wants to come down from his chair, and then we spend the next hour or two following him around, feeding him as he plays with his toys.  By the time he is done eating, it's often almost 8:00, sometimes later. 

After doing his nighttime routine of bath and singing, he usually ends up going to bed between 9:15 and 9:30 pm.

He sleeps well and sleeps until 8:00 and 8:30 the next morning.  We have a nanny so we let him sleep as late as he wants. 

I know that a 9:30pm bedtime isn't normal for a 3 year old, but how can we get him to bed earlier when he takes so long to eat?  

1. It's hard to start dinner much earlier since we both work and it's hard to get food on the table quickly.
2. We are reluctant to just let him ""not eat if he's not hungry"" because he is slowly sliding down the growth curve, from 70th percentile height/weight at 18 months to 20-25th percentile at 3 years.  This is a big concern of ours and may be a post for a later time.

&lt;p&gt;Well my kiddo is kind of a snack junkie, let&amp;#39;s be honest what toddler isnt. Well half the class have parents that force the health nut food choices on them so I&amp;#39;m trying to find an appropriate snack to share. Other than organic apple juice or organic local apple cider I&amp;#39;m kind of at a loss.
 So I need help with snack suggestions, the only food sensitivity is dairy (thank god.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for any suggestions on snack ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

We all parent very differently but I really think the world of them and we have been friends now for about 3 years. (All names changed) I have 2 children Joe, 6 and Billy 4 my friend Sarah has child David 7 and friend Laura  has children Roger 6 and Paul 1.

Background:

David and Roger have been friends for a couple of years longer and Roger especially views David as his best friend. For a long time when they would play they would deliberately exclude anyone else and it could get physcial if anyone else tried to play. Due to this I have only done playdates with each child on a one to one basis with my 2 children. Generally they all play nicely that way. 

Roger is also very manipulative,  he does not like to be left out and will generally engineer it so that he has options if one child stops wanting to play his game. This is something the school have brought up to his mum previously and I know she is working on it.

I have also previously caught David telling Roger to blame something on my son Joe when he didn't realise I was listening.

The last year the kids after school stuff has taken off and between us all we genrally only have one day a week to catch up.

David and Roger have matured to point they don't deliberately exclude other children but they do pick up games where they left off or play made up games that they have devised the rules beforehand. My son Joe does not handle this well at all and will not join in the pre-made games and can often end up in tears as he feels left out. Neither one of the boys has expressly told him they cant play so its hard. Most of the time we have ended up telling them to take turns playing each other's games but that really tends to go south between Joe and Roger with epic amounts of drama between them.  

I have started telling them not to take turns but to talk about the rules of the games together and devise something they all want to play. This works well for my son Joe and David but not so much for Roger.

In the end I have said to the other mums that I would prefer to continue to stick to one to one playdates as I dont feel my son is mature yet to handle all of it. Also on one to one playdates my youngest Billy will be allowed to play but not really when they are all together. 

They did come to me and say they felt my son didnt know how to play with other kids as so much of his time is structured and he just never gets time to play. I wont lie that did upset me. He plays alot with his brother (18 months difference) he does Beavers, swimming gymnastics and drama. I personally wouldnt want to add anything else but dont think its too much? 

My problem is one of the other mums is really unhappy and wants them to all play together. I have noticed she has started to cancel playdates with us and generally is pulling away. I know I would be sad to loose this friendship and I know my son really likes hers as well. Should I just do joint playdates and have the drama?

However  I am worried that my son is having difficulties forming friendships and playing nicely too. He always is fine on small playdates (with these and other children) but doesn't have a best friend who he wants to play with all time , he does have a couple of people he plays with at school.

I can keep going, but I struggle with friendships and maintaining them and am just not sure if I am right in asking to keep it to one to one playdates as my other friends seem so upset.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am good friends with 2 mums.

OK rant /advice wanted 
I have tried to raise her well, push her strengths and desires and work on her weakness (often organisation lol as most kids are)

Nothing is barred from her, learning about motorbikes and how they work when I service mine, playing video games with the wife and I rough play, blowing up volcanos in the garden because it's fun.. Nothing if she wants to try it and we can, we do.

I had to remove her from school and get her placed into a different one because the teacher (f) had said video games are a disgusting boys pastime and are not for little girls... That shook her up, genuinely confused and upset her.

My daughters also very tall for her age often gets confused with 14-15 year olds. Often this is a source of redicule and the first school have somehow managed to ""impress"" onto her that she must never fight back as a girl... Damned if I know how to get her to even defend herself I just don't understand how it's become part of her ""core persona""

As well as being tall she's a little above the ""normal"" weight lines, nothing concerning, no health risks, issues, lack of athleticism just a little bit rounder in the face, something else she's been  rediculed with. I have discussed with her she's perfectly fine as she is, but we have noticed random questions out of the blue in regards to ""how many calories are in that?"". I've sat her down and explained how everyone is different, what's normal for one isn't for another and if she genuinely wants to change her body size then we can look at some extra curriculum activities but that it should be something that she enjoys, working on your body takes time and will power alone won't stay you for the months it takes to see the results, however doing something that you enjoy will help you keep at it and maybe even not notice the hard work you do. 

Which brings me to the final rant/question 
We have just finished school clothes shopping... She's apparently in 3 different stores ADULT size 12 in trousers and 14 in tops... NO SHE BLOODY ISN'T! As a man I can walk into any shop knowing a size 34 waist and 16 shirt will fit ANY STORE! Why on earth do we have to check 7 different stores out to find out she ranges from size 14-15 years - size adult 12? A 9 year old is size 12 adult? Great way to destroy a girls self confidence! She's not overweight! If anything it appears as if she's about to go through a growth spurt (again oh my poor wallet). Clothing stores need to get their goddam acts together and uniform the goddam sizes. 

Any advice on how to make sure I can impress onto her and it sinks in she's fine, she's normal, there's nothing wrong with her as we have had to deal with the first wet night in ages so I know shes letting it get to her!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off I&amp;#39;m a UK father to a soon to be 10 year old girl already on the path of womanhood and taking most things in her stride well.

&lt;p&gt;As well as being tall she&amp;#39;s a little above the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; weight lines, nothing concerning, no health risks, issues, lack of athleticism just a little bit rounder in the face, something else she&amp;#39;s been  rediculed with. I have discussed with her she&amp;#39;s perfectly fine as she is, but we have noticed random questions out of the blue in regards to &amp;quot;how many calories are in that?&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ve sat her down and explained how everyone is different, what&amp;#39;s normal for one isn&amp;#39;t for another and if she genuinely wants to change her body size then we can look at some extra curriculum activities but that it should be something that she enjoys, working on your body takes time and will power alone won&amp;#39;t stay you for the months it takes to see the results, however doing something that you enjoy will help you keep at it and maybe even not notice the hard work you do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the final rant/question 
We have just finished school clothes shopping... She&amp;#39;s apparently in 3 different stores ADULT size 12 in trousers and 14 in tops... NO SHE BLOODY ISN&amp;#39;T! As a man I can walk into any shop knowing a size 34 waist and 16 shirt will fit ANY STORE! Why on earth do we have to check 7 different stores out to find out she ranges from size 14-15 years - size adult 12? A 9 year old is size 12 adult? Great way to destroy a girls self confidence! She&amp;#39;s not overweight! If anything it appears as if she&amp;#39;s about to go through a growth spurt (again oh my poor wallet). Clothing stores need to get their goddam acts together and uniform the goddam sizes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice on how to make sure I can impress onto her and it sinks in she&amp;#39;s fine, she&amp;#39;s normal, there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with her as we have had to deal with the first wet night in ages so I know shes letting it get to her!&lt;/p&gt;

Trying not to pressure him and thinking he'd eventually grow out of it we let him poop in a pull-up after attempting to poop in this potty. Fast forward a year, he's in preschool. We cannot get him to poop in the potty. He poops in his pants every day. If he does tell us he needs to poop and we rush to sit him on the potty he suddenly doesn't need to. It's maddening.

We've lost our patience and yelled at him, forced him to sit there until he goes, which, in fear of being cruel it is never more than 20-30 minutes. He cries and says he doesn't have to go. Finally we let him out and voila, he poops his pants. 

His mom and I are just baffled. He is so smart, and very mature thinking for his age. But we just done know what to do with him. Does anyone have any suggestions?

He is the brightest, smartest, and funniest kid, but for some reason he WILL NOT poop in the toilet. When he was getting potty trained he took on to peeing almost instantly but always was hesitant about pooping. Trying not to pressure him and thinking he&amp;#39;d eventually grow out of it we let him poop in a pull-up after attempting to poop in this potty. Fast forward a year, he&amp;#39;s in preschool. We cannot get him to poop in the potty. He poops in his pants every day. If he does tell us he needs to poop and we rush to sit him on the potty he suddenly doesn&amp;#39;t need to. It&amp;#39;s maddening. And I don&amp;#39;t know how best to handle it. We&amp;#39;ve tried to be understanding and sit in the bathroom w him for log periods of time. We&amp;#39;ve lost our patience and yelled at him, forced him to sit there until he goes, which, in fear of being cruel it is never more than 20-30 minutes. He cries and says he doesn&amp;#39;t have to go. Finally we let him out and voila, he poops his pants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His mom and I are just baffled. He is so smart, and very mature thinking for his age. But we just done know what to do with him. Does anyone have any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

Okay- so I am a 28 year old mom to two beautiful girls with beautiful long hair... and they have lice!!! I have NEVER in all of my life had to deal with this!! I have a few questions, and google is not helping! Anyone with advice? 
(just want to state that I am not seeking medical advice, just advice from parents who have been through this!) 

1. Noticed lice on Saturday. Nits and live lice. Called doctor and she said to treat with Nix and to repeat in nine days. Treated the girls hair on Saturday, combed out everything I could. 
2. About 18-24 hours later (on Sunday) I recombed the girls hair. Still found live lice, but less than 10 on each head.
3. It has now been 48 hours and I have found about five live lice on each of their heads. One of my daughters has several nits still. I can’t get them all out, but daily I am combing and pulling out what I can. 

My question is, is it normal to still see a few lice that are alive? They were very slow, barely moving. But when will they be gone? Also, should I attempt to get EVERY nit out of the hair? One of my daughters has to still have about 30 in her hair. Maybe not that many, but it just seems like a lot. 

Also, is it safe to send them to school? It came from school and the school has been notified. They do not have a no nit policy, and the doctor has said that the nits do not mean active infestation. Blaaaah! 

I just want to make sure I am doing the right thing. This has been days of just googling, combing, washing, repeat. Am I doing this right?!?

For the last 9 years, I’ve been head coach of our high school’s football team and the last 7 as the assistant coach to the girls’ basketball team. During my free time, I coach any little league team the recreation center needs me to. To summarize, I’ve seen a lot of parent coaches in my time at all levels of play and was wondering if you had any stories.

My favorite was my third year of volunteering at the recreation center. I was a stay at home dad the first few years my twins were born, and coaching was the perfect way to keep myself from going stir crazy. I was assigned a girls soccer team ages 7-10. It was the first game of the season and my team was doing well. Coach of the other team was only addressing his daughter. She was a forward, but she was chasing the ball the entire game. She missed a penalty shot and coach lost his mind. Started making his way on the field claiming the goalie was making faces and that’s why she missed. In anger he kicked the ball which hit the top of the goal and came right back at him. He then picked up the ball and threw it toward the crowd and hit his wife. We didn’t play them again that season.

There’s also the entire issue of parents on the sidelines. My first year as assistant coach, I had to deal with a mom who threw her shoe at the girl who fouled her daughter. 

So any stories or opinions? I’ve coached all my children, and I have to admit I’ve lost my cool a couple times too, but that’s for another post. Do you think parents should coach their children?

So our son is 3 months old. I typically watch him in the mornings before work, and 5-7 before he goes to bed.

He is now napping in his crib which we transitioned him to.

Putting him down for his morning nap is no issue, takes about 5 minutes and I have no problems with it.

My 5-8pm time with him is tough, he’s moody the whole time which I get. 

It’s essential he gets a small nap around 5. He needs to be cradled and held until he’s relaxed and then put down in the crib.

For some reason at this time he is crazy fussy with me but with my wife he goes down in 5-10 minutes no problem. I try (and it kills my back, I have back issues and it’s hard to cradle and hold him that long in one spot). So I usually try he goes nuts and my wife comes in calms him and he’s out in 5 minutes.

She’s basically fed up with having to do that because it’s supposed to be my time with him. I get that, but it’s a huge struggle and I’m doing my best it’s not my fault I can’t put him to sleep.

Her friend told her to just let me do it even if he cries for 25 minutes to just tough it out and I should figure it out.

I completely disagreed as he’s only 3 months, but agreed to do it. He went nuts for 20 minutes and was drenched in sweat, my wife couldn’t take the crying came up and put him down in 30 seconds. 

Well now things are worse, he goes crazy even as I approach the room with him for nap time. Those lovely morning naps I would put him down for have turned into a nightmare and now I can’t put him down at all anymore. 

Any advice? I’m annoyed they didn’t listen to me as I knew it would give him a negative association with naps as he’s too young at this point to just scream it out with me in the dark. Now I can’t even put him down for naps during the day let alone 530pm

I have two children with my ex partner. We have never got on even when we were together it was a poisonous relationship. After our second child was born I left shortly after. 

Move on 5 years and everything has been fine with the children but she always argues or tries to control what we do. I’ve since got a partner and before she found out nothing changed. 

When she did find out I had a partner she started turning up at the house unannounced and crying that she couldn’t cope with me moving on she didn’t realise it would hurt her this much. My ex partner has had multiple partners since we split who have moved in with her. 

She eventually got a partner and now I seemed to have been pushed out of the situation. She stopped me seeing the children, demand large payouts before I could see them again. She has since let me see them again and has now taken them away from me again and moved away to start a new life with my children and is allowing me no contact whatsoever. 

I want to be there for my two girls and see them but she won’t listen. Those girls mean the world to me. I’ve tried court but I need to find her new aggressive as I don’t want to be sending bailiffs to their new home as it’s not fair on my children! 

She has replaced me as their dad at their new school and all new contact details are her new partner, I cannot even be kept up to date with how they are getting on

Surely someone can help!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, I’m new to this sort of thing but desperately looking for other people’s advice if they have been through the same situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two children with my ex partner. We have never got on even when we were together it was a poisonous relationship. After our second child was born I left shortly after. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Move on 5 years and everything has been fine with the children but she always argues or tries to control what we do. I’ve since got a partner and before she found out nothing changed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she did find out I had a partner she started turning up at the house unannounced and crying that she couldn’t cope with me moving on she didn’t realise it would hurt her this much. My ex partner has had multiple partners since we split who have moved in with her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She eventually got a partner and now I seemed to have been pushed out of the situation. She stopped me seeing the children, demand large payouts before I could see them again. She has since let me see them again and has now taken them away from me again and moved away to start a new life with my children and is allowing me no contact whatsoever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be there for my two girls and see them but she won’t listen. Those girls mean the world to me. I’ve tried court but I need to find her new aggressive as I don’t want to be sending bailiffs to their new home as it’s not fair on my children! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has replaced me as their dad at their new school and all new contact details are her new partner, I cannot even be kept up to date with how they are getting on &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone any advice on how to deal with her or if there is a way I can find out what school they have moved to without having to speak to her. &lt;/p&gt;

A close friend of mine has a son aged 6. At a recent Parent-Teacher Interview, the teacher commented that it's a battle to get him to read anything in class (More-so then the other kids in his grade apparently). The teacher asked them to further work on his reading skills at home. So my friend and her partner are trying to put more focus on those skills. I'm a big reader myself so I've been trying to assist where I can by buying them books. So far its been mixed at best.

He's in kindergarten and the school regularly gives him books with 1-2 lines a page to read as part of his homework. He gets through them in a reasonable time but he seems to be uninterested when reading them. I bought them a number of **Captain Underpants** books (he loves the movie) but they seem to be a bit too much. He actually wants to read them but struggles with them on his own (and eventually gives up). My friends partner started reading the books to him before bed to help encourage him.

His mother and I have been speaking to a local book store and trying a few things. We initially tried books like **The Day The Crayons Quit**, which he liked (and re-read himself multiple times) but he now gets through them quickly. The book store suggested we try **D-Bot Squad** and **Hey Jack**. He was able to read them when pushed but it was obvious they didn't really interest him. I somewhat suspect that his issue is that he's so disinterested by reading.

Oddly enough, they got him Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu on his Nintendo Switch recently and we overheard him reading the dialogue out loud. Pokemon interested him enough to start reading on his own, we also overheard him sounding out the words (and Pokemon names) that he didn't know.

From what I've been told by his parents, at the Parent-Teacher Interview the teachers were happy with everything else. His math and his social skills/working with the other kids was particularly praised. Its just the reading that needs to be addressed.

So Parents, has anyone been in a similar situation?  
Does anyone have any recommendations on books I can look into getting him to help build his interest? Or maybe some activities I could pass on to his parents to try with him? Currently I've ordered a few Scholastic Pokemon books for him as I think they'll interest him enough to read, but I'd rather try and find some variety if possible.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, hoping someone can provide some assistance.&lt;br/&gt;

I have no idea what to do anymore, and am totally lost, and I come here hoping that maybe someone could have some advice for me. Anything is helpful. Sorry in advance for any formatting issues, as I’m on mobile.

I am a 14 year old kid who has finally come to terms with the fact that I am not female, but in fact, male. I’ve struggled with my gender identity ever since I was 12, and went back and forth about being everything from bigender to a demigirl. Knowing who I am once and for all has been a huge confidence booster, and online friends have been extremely supportive of me. So, awesome, I’m transgender! Yippee! However, here’s the problem: my family is Christian (I’m also a closeted atheist) and quite against the LGBT+ community.

Not awesome!

I live with my dad [53M], who is generally an amazing person, along with three siblings [M11, M8, &amp; M4]. My father is extremely supportive of me and my passions, and we’re very close in my eyes for father/son. However, as of late, I believe we’ve had a large rift in our relationship due to me discovering this aspect of myself. I feel different— like I’m lying to him (I mean, technically, I am) about merely existing. Every time he calls me his ‘daughter,’ I cringe internally, but just have to smile through it. I’m not his daughter. I’m his son. It hurts to hear, even though I know it’s not his fault.

I think he knows I’m a little bit more distant of late as well. He’s asked me a few times (varying from in casual conversation to during serious discussions) if there’s something I’m hiding from him, or if I feel like I can’t tell him something. I always say no, even though it’s not true. I’m afraid of how he’ll react if I admit to him that I’m transgender. 

Most likely, I think he’d try to play it off as a phase, or tell me I don’t actually understand what it means. There’s also the very real possibility that he’d whip out the good ol’ Bible and explain to me that being trans is bad— which especially sucks when you’re atheist. I respect the family religion, and don’t try to vote out of prayer, vocally discredit anything they say, or mock religious people, but I do not personally believe in gods or an afterlife. 

I discussed this with him once *very* briefly, but I didn’t even divulge the entire truth— I just told him I was uncertain about my faith, when in reality, I’m actually very confident in being an atheist. He seemed to brush it aside, as he still acts like I’m a Christian. I let it go, because it makes very little difference to me at the moment.

Anyways, back on the topic of being trans. I really want to tell him the truth and mend our relationship back to the way it was, but if he takes it wrongly, I fear that we’ll grow even farther apart. I have reason to believe that, even though he wouldn’t kick me out or anything, he would completely ignore how I feel about myself, which would cause me to start resenting him.

He’s done the same when it came to me voicing my concerns about being depressed (as well as anxiety and possible PTSD, but god forbid I list *multiple* issues), which is part of why I’m so reluctant. I timidly brought it up once during a coffee between the two of us, and he flipped out, raising his voice and yelling “You don’t have a MENTAL ILLNESS! Don’t even start!” I just said okay and stopped talking about it immediately. That still sticks with me and is super painful, as I have absolutely nobody to talk to except for him. My very few ‘friends’ in real life are literally all from my ultra-religious school that’re everything you think of when you hear ‘stereotypical Christian,’ so obviously I can’t share my worries with them either. All I have are online friends, and even they can only bear so much baggage.

It doesn’t help that we’re going through an ENORMOUS divorce right now that is just coming to a dramatic finale in hopefully the next week or two after a two year battle. The best case scenario is that my dad gets full custody of me and my brothers, and the worse case is my mother getting full custody. My mother is a former alcoholic who is still a pathological liar, and was extremely abusive to my dad for years before the divorce. 

She has eyes and ears on everything, and has manipulated most of my friends’ parents into thinking that SHE is the victim. Even going to a therapist could apparently end in the therapist having to give up her notes on me to court (according to my dad), which would cause even MORE problems. 

So I’m also afraid that coming out as trans could worsen the court case. He doesn’t even want me to cut my *hair* short again until the case is over, which is a huge issue with me. I like short hair, but my dad won’t let me get anything more than a pixie cut, and now that it’s growing out, it looks AWFUL. For some reason he’s afraid that the court will spin it in a bad light if I cut it short again? I think it’s ridiculous, but I don’t know everything about the case, so maybe he’s right. I don’t know.

All in all, I’m lost. I want to repair our relationship, but I’m afraid that coming out has far more cons than pros. Should I just stick it out for a few more years, or should I suck it up and go ahead and tell him?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello! I have no idea what to do anymore, and am totally lost, and I come here hoping that maybe someone could have some advice for me. Anything is helpful. Sorry in advance for any formatting issues, as I’m on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a 14 year old kid who has finally come to terms with the fact that I am not female, but in fact, male. I’ve struggled with my gender identity ever since I was 12, and went back and forth about being everything from bigender to a demigirl. Knowing who I am once and for all has been a huge confidence booster, and online friends have been extremely supportive of me. So, awesome, I’m transgender! Yippee! However, here’s the problem: my family is Christian (I’m also a closeted atheist) and quite against the LGBT+ community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live with my dad [53M], who is generally an amazing person, along with three siblings [M11, M8, &amp;amp; M4]. My father is extremely supportive of me and my passions, and we’re very close in my eyes for father/son. However, as of late, I believe we’ve had a large rift in our relationship due to me discovering this aspect of myself. I feel different— like I’m lying to him (I mean, technically, I am) about merely existing. Every time he calls me his ‘daughter,’ I cringe internally, but just have to smile through it. I’m not his daughter. I’m his son. It hurts to hear, even though I know it’s not his fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think he knows I’m a little bit more distant of late as well. He’s asked me a few times (varying from in casual conversation to during serious discussions) if there’s something I’m hiding from him, or if I feel like I can’t tell him something. I always say no, even though it’s not true. I’m afraid of how he’ll react if I admit to him that I’m transgender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most likely, I think he’d try to play it off as a phase, or tell me I don’t actually understand what it means. There’s also the very real possibility that he’d whip out the good ol’ Bible and explain to me that being trans is bad— which especially sucks when you’re atheist. I respect the family religion, and don’t try to vote out of prayer, vocally discredit anything they say, or mock religious people, but I do not personally believe in gods or an afterlife. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discussed this with him once &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; briefly, but I didn’t even divulge the entire truth— I just told him I was uncertain about my faith, when in reality, I’m actually very confident in being an atheist. He seemed to brush it aside, as he still acts like I’m a Christian. I let it go, because it makes very little difference to me at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, back on the topic of being trans.

She's smart, has a few friends, 3 school ones and 2 closer ones in a different school that are solely the ones she spends time with outside of school.
Doesn't see them too much, maybe 2 a month but talks to the one on Skype almost every day.
Daughter has been in a lot of different extra curricular activities throughout elementary school. Brownies (Canada's girl scouts), art classes,dance, more art, pottery, math tutoring, and band.
Every single one of these (except pottery as it isn't an ongoing thing) she has quit. 
She's been in band for 2 years, I put her in band camp last summer and it was pretty ok, this year she cried about it and said it wasn't fun so she dropped out of camp after a day. 
Now she wants to quit band entirely. 
I feel she should be in something but she says she doesn't have interest in anything and can do these things at home. Granted yes, she'll knit and draw and cross stitch but she puts it down and sometimes won't do it again for 2 months.  
I feel like an inadequate parent for not having my kid in anything but I think saying ""if you don't pick something I will"" is not a good idea either. 
I myself am the same though so I feel extra guilt because I have no hobbies or interests. I know I'm not going to change. Am I at fault for leading a bad example?

&amp;#x200B;

Heres my dilemma for if that happens.

I have a stepmother, I hate her guts. My birth mother had nothing to do with raising me. I dont really know what a mother is actually supposed to do let alone a stepmother, beyond supplying physical goods (and i will not be buying this girls affection ive already decided that much, it did not help me like my stepmother)

&amp;#x200B;

The only real example I have for what a mum is supposed to do is watching my sister raise her two girls. She's affectionate in a way i wish my parents could have been and my nieces are so comfortable going to her about things i would never have dared talk to my parents about.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously when/if i meet this guys little girl i cant jump straight to a parenting role, her actual mum is still in the picture, i wouldnt dream of causing conflict, at least not intentionally. Im thinking I'm going to try my best to just be somebody she is comfortable being around and coming to with questions or the like. I dont want her to hate me, or be uncomfortable around me. But im also already aware her dad probably lets her get away with a lot (the whole custody battle thats going on and her being his little princess) and I know im not going to be able to do the same if i ever am expected to help fill any kind of parenting role. I guess i have a stricter outlook on the way kids should behave (my nieces have learned growling at me in place of words is not the way to talk to me, and entitlement gets things taken off you).

&amp;#x200B;

The good thing is i have had practice looking after my nieces, the bad news is they are super easy to look after so its not very good practice for conflict resolution. (they are 6 and 2) the youngest has been the most challenging, but only until she hits the third warning and gets put in time out. She usually behaves after the first time out (which lasts 2 minutes, one minute per year of age)

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of this will be solved when the time comes through pure communication with dad and maybe mum depending on how receptive she is. But what are some universal things i need to keep in mind going into this? In regards to respecting the current parenting strategies, whatever they may be, and keeping his daughters needs in mind?

We are a couple of middle aged people living in the DC area. This is our first child and she will be 3 months old when it was planned for her to go into daycare. Recently my wife has become incredibly insistent on one-on-one care until at least one year of age going so far as be willing to quit her new, hard-found job.

Part of it is this article (https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/going-beyond-intelligence/201702/preschool-nanny-parental-care-daycare-what-s-best) she read, but even there it says that at the end of the day, it's homelife that is most important. And we both have issues with that article in that it doesn't tell you how much better or worse the outcome is or how much you can go above the 30 hour/week daycare number or how much you should stay below.

A large part of this is finances. The interim daycare we found is incredibly expensive at around $2700/mo (and that we've already paid the first month for), but it dovetails into our later daycare plans which will be a more reasonable $1700/mo, which will hopefully be sooner than later, but it's unclear exactly when (waitlists...). We haven't yet looked into the cost of a nanny, but I'd imagine in our area it's going to be at least $3k/mo. A nanny-share could be cheaper but logistically challenging.

Aside from the financial aspect, the $2700 daycare is across the street from her workplace and the $1700 daycare is IN my workplace. We went with the $2700 daycare because they're both in the same franchise and use the same system. Transferring from one to the other would be, as far as I can tell, seamless. I'm not sure what my wife would want to do if the $1700 daycare had availibilty before one year of age.

I agree that one-on-one is ""best"", but daycare, particularly the one we'd be sending her to, is still ""good"". There is always something better and it's not like nannies don't have their cons. For context, she also insisted on spending $1k+ on cordblood storage, which in my opinion was a waste of money that I couldn't stop her on. But my question is how much worse is daycare to the development and care of our child, particularly at 3 months old? Are there any (other) studies/numbers that can quantify this?

One particular issue she had with daycare is that in that facility, she would be taken care of in not only a 1:4 ratio, but also that she'd be in a room with 11 other children, which could be noisy and stressful. That seems acceptable to me, particularly when you couple it with some pros like having backups for caregivers, etc... 

Part of my issue is that her decision-making appears to me to be colored by irrationality. How much of her insistence could be attributed to something like separation anxiety, which I understand is common? For instance, before she was all about moving into the city and buying an expensive house, and her career. Now, she's willing to put it all on hold, indefinitely if needs be (but not all the way to age 18). Contributing to this could be the fact that I've been back to work for over a month now and she's at home taking care of our child all day. On this point, I certainly could be helping more with childcare and decisions, but I do try.

Anyway, that seems like enough, but hopefully not too much.

I call them “mom” and “dad” and their children “brother” and “sister.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all the children I’m the youngest and the only one still single and childless. I also live the furtherest away from home (I live across the country). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do well for myself but it would take me ~4 months to save ~$4500. That $4500 I would use for a down payment for a new (to me) car. I want to ask my parents for some help with this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know my parents have helped my siblings  financially for things like house down payments and cars but for some reason I can being myself to ask. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made dumb money decisions in my early 20s much of that my family knows about. Things a lot of young men in college with little finical literacy do. Buy things you cannot afford on credit, buy a brand knew car (I sold that and got a beater years ago which is why I am needing a new car soon) etc etc. &lt;/p&gt;

Is that normal? It strikes me as odd because his kids are in school/camp most of the time. He isn't filthy rich. The nanny is $50,000 per year. It seems really bizarre and wasteful to me.

He lives in a suburb right outside NYC in a really modest small house with his ex wife (they're separated and live in separate bedrooms).

His wife *works from home full time* as a lawyer. His wife supposedly doesn't really have much work to do, she reads blogs all day.

He claims his wife ""bosses the nanny around all day"" while the wife stands in their small hallway--as the wife works from home. He says the nanny isn't a maid, he says the nanny is really there for the kids. The nanny does laundry and light cleanup, but it seems bizarre and unnecessary. The nanny also manages their weekly cleaning person. Again, they aren't filthy rich and they live in a tiny modest house.

It feels so weird to me. So when the kids are away at camp/school during the day (all year long), the nanny chills with the wife at their small house. Emphasis on ""small"" because it's not like the wife can escape the nanny for privacy.

The nanny's hours are M-F 7am-5pm. But the kids are at school or camp all day long.

Is this a thing?? Is this abnormal and should I be concerned? I'm weirded out because my boyfriend is weirdly obsessed with the nanny drama (she's always fighting with his ex wife at the house daily or getting into his family's drama). It seems so weird to me due to how the nanny hardly sees the kids...why does he keep her full time?

He isn't super rich. Is it some weird thing I supposedly have no concept of due to my limited boring upbringing? My parents used babysitters that were only a few years older than me up until I was 10.

My husband and I have been together over ten years, met in high school, both went to college and graduated, married in 2017 and just bought our house last year.  We are getting to the baby step (literally) and I’ve been thinking deeper into it than usual now that it’s becoming a reality. I got my bachelors in Accounting and have built up a lot of experience over the years in the private and public sector. I’ve recently been applying to accounting positions I would consider my dream career, but it’s causing me to think “what’s the point if I’m just gonna spit out a kid in a year?”

My current job there is no room for growth and my workload has dropped significantly, so I feel my brain is regressing each day. I’m dying to get out and move forward with a job that would challenge me, something I can see myself retiring from.

All my friends (all whopping four of them) have different ‘paths’ so I can’t discuss with them. Three of them got married and started having kids a few years after high school and have been stay at home moms since, the fourth is adamant she does not want kids and is just enjoying life. The SAHMs of course are pushing us to have kids and “everything will work out in the end, you just have to go for it”, but they don’t understand cause none of them went to college and spent years building a career. My fourth friend sits and listens, but she also did not go to college and doesn’t have a career per se. 

My mom has no college education and had kids but still worked, so she says it’s all possible, but that was a different economy at the time as well. She hates her job now (which is the same field she worked when she was pregnant and having kids), so she doesn’t understand the love of a career you’ve built up over the years.

I guess my big fear is: I really want to stay at home with my kids, at least until they’re potty trained because I strongly believe in social interaction before PreK and Kindergarten, but that would put a huge gap in my work experience. We only want two kids, back to back so they’re close in age. With pregnancies at 9 months each, that puts me at least 5 years out of the workforce.

I've been the caregiver of a 16 year old for 9 months now since I've moved in with my boyfriend. In the last 3 months we've noticed that she's begun lying exorbitantly about the silliest of things.

We know she was raised in a chaotic home, but she's always been safe, accepted, and well cared for by her uncle since she was born. He has always been in her life and has been the major care giver when her mom was preoccupied.
Should we be concerned? What steps can, or should, be taken to curb this behavior? Punishment, such as grounding, or manual labor, are out of the question.

Some background on me: 
- 22 M (I come from Hispanic parents) 
- Graduated from a NYC college 2 months ago 
- I love listening to music on a daily basis
(Currently listening to “Celebration” by Kool and the Gang~ its on repeat) 
- I currently work at a non-profit organization (according to Glassdoor) in NY. 
- Been here for 1 month, 2 months left. 

My parents raised me to be kind, understanding, and to help those that really need help. I still have those traits as I type this. 

Anyways, I’m a temp-for-hire at a non-profit doing some accounting work (pretty repetitive stuff). This department is mostly filled with mothers but the head of the department (controller) overlooks everyone here but only when he’s in (guy that hired me).  

About 2 hours ago (I’m at lunch), the one employee who I have been helping wanted to talk to me privately. I knew what she was about to say to me when I was walking into her cubicle. She told me that I have been making the same mistakes on the accounting program we are using (it’s something so little that I’m missing and I’m getting everything else right) and that its due to my headphones being on. I could tell she’s annoyed to tell me this and I nod my head and say “I’m sorry and I’ll fix that starting now.” 

My headphones have been on last week and the week before that and she hasn’t mention that at all until now. 

I’ve seen her and other mothers use their headphones through the day (I caught one watching a movie/ show on their phone!) 

I know I have lots to learn about working and adapting myself to satisfy others while working. Maybe (if you hate younger people: it’s definitely me) it’s me who’s in the red. 

Anyways,  I know I’m on the wrong subreddit but I just wanted to hear your thoughts on this situation. What would you say to your kid if he/ she told you that they (want/ need) to listen to music to get through the day? 

As a Result: I take my sweet time to get stuff done (productivity decreased by a factor of 2) and I frequent the bathroom to just listen to music ~ Kool and the Gang’s Celebration at least three times ~ before I head back to the dull cubicle.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question is designated to those white-collar working parents.

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I’m a temp-for-hire at a non-profit doing some accounting work (pretty repetitive stuff). This department is mostly filled with mothers but the head of the department (controller) overlooks everyone here but only when he’s in (guy that hired me).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 2 hours ago (I’m at lunch), the one employee who I have been helping wanted to talk to me privately. I knew what she was about to say to me when I was walking into her cubicle. She told me that I have been making the same mistakes on the accounting program we are using (it’s something so little that I’m missing and I’m getting everything else right) and that its due to my headphones being on. I could tell she’s annoyed to tell me this and I nod my head and say “I’m sorry and I’ll fix that starting now.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My headphones have been on last week and the week before that and she hasn’t mention that at all until now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen her and other mothers use their headphones through the day (I caught one watching a movie/ show on their phone!) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I have lots to learn about working and adapting myself to satisfy others while working. Maybe (if you hate younger people: it’s definitely me) it’s me who’s in the red. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways,  I know I’m on the wrong subreddit but I just wanted to hear your thoughts on this situation. What would you say to your kid if he/ she told you that they (want/ need) to listen to music to get through the day? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Result: I take my sweet time to get stuff done (productivity decreased by a factor of 2) and I frequent the bathroom to just listen to music ~ Kool and the Gang’s Celebration at least three times ~ before I head back to the dull cubicle.&lt;/p&gt;

# [How To Touch The Heart Of Your Children](https://simplylifetips.com/touch-the-heart-of-your-children/)

Children’s heart is clean and soft. Shouting or any kind of punishment can make a severe wound in their heart which can affect the mental health. This wound may affect their self-confidence and sometimes fill their mind with anger and revenge. 

Some wounds heal fast, but some remain unhealed for many years. What is the best method to handle children? The best method is to touch the heart of children through unconditional love, make them understand their mistakes and the consequences.

Families who upgrade now can enjoy extra features with [**GoKid Pro**](https://www.gokid.mobi/gokid-pro/) free for the first month!

With more younger kids using smartphones or smart devices, it is imperative that parents stay on top of their digital habits and find the best apps for children that will help them navigate the online world safely.

[Common Sense Media](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/lists/best-apps-for-kids-ages-9-12) explains, “Preteens need concrete guidelines for responsible use of the smartphone — these are powerful little devices. They also need to know what your expectations are for responsible, respectful online behavior.”

When it comes to finding great apps for kids 8-12 years old, you must look for apps that they will actually use and enjoy; however, it is also important to look for apps that will keep them safe (such as apps with parental control options) and educate them.

We’ve identified the top apps for children 8-12 years old to help you hand your kid a smartphone without fear.

**1 – Froggipedia**

[Froggipedia](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/froggipedia/id1348306157?mt=8) has been named the Top iPad app of 2018 by Apple. Considering the millions of apps available, this award means it is a winner. Froggipedia is an AR app (augmented reality) that allows users to explore and learn about the anatomy of a frog – without the dissection.

**2 – Box Island**

With the STEM movement on the rise, kids have opportunities to learn new skills in fun ways. For example, [Box Island](https://boxisland.io/) is a computer science game app that uniquely teaches kids coding. Plus, the combination of STEM learning and fun makes this one of the best free apps for kids!

**3 – Marble Math**

Another educational app that using gaming to reinforce skills is [Marble Math](https://artgigapps.com/apps/marble-math). As the name suggests, this award-winning app combines math and mazes.

**4 – Duolingo**

For middle schoolers and up, [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) is one of the best free apps for kids when it comes to language learning. Users can choose a language and then play games to build their vocabulary and fluency. And it doesn’t stop there: Parents can learn along with their kids, as every family member gets their own profile.

**5 – A Dark Room**

[A Dark Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dark_Room) is totally different from all other game apps that rely heavily on graphics. Instead, A Dark Room is a strictly text-based adventure game that forces kids to think outside the box.

**6 – Gorogoa**

The 2018 iPad Game of the Year title went to [Gorogoa](http://gorogoa.com/), and it is easy to see why. This is a visually-rich puzzle game that will challenge kids and adults alike.

**7 – The Infinite Arcade**

Another playful way to reinforce STEM skills is the game app [The Infinite Arcade by Tinybop](https://tinybop.com/apps/the-infinite-arcade). In this app, users design and build their own arcade games.

**8 – GarageBand**

Looking for an app for your music-loving kid? One of the best free apps for kids is [GarageBand](https://www.apple.com/ios/garageband/). This app lets kids record, edit, and produce high-quality music tracks.

**9 – Terraria**

If your kids love Minecraft but are aging out of it, introduce them to [Terraria](https://terraria.org/). Terraria is a multi-player game, but tweens will only compete locally (or with people they know) rather than strangers.

**10 – Kudos**

Parents looking for a safe way to introduce their tweens to social media will love [Kudos](https://www.kudos.com/). Essentially, this is a safe, photo-sharing app for tweens. Best of all, parents are informed of their kid’s activities on this platform.

As with all digital content, moderating usage is key. We are big fans of setting time limits and like that Apple lets you now monitor and set downtimes.

&lt;p&gt;If your kids love Minecraft but are aging out of it, introduce them to &lt;a href=""https://terraria.org/""&gt;Terraria&lt;/a&gt;. Terraria is a multi-player game, but tweens will only compete locally (or with people they know) rather than strangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 – Kudos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parents looking for a safe way to introduce their tweens to social media will love &lt;a href=""https://www.kudos.com/""&gt;Kudos&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, this is a safe, photo-sharing app for tweens. Best of all, parents are informed of their kid’s activities on this platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all digital content, moderating usage is key. We are big fans of setting time limits and like that Apple lets you now monitor and set downtimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there an app you recommend for parents of kids in this age group? Let us know!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

New to reddit, but a friend suggested I try this since my parents and I have run out of options. I am currently in my early 20s with a younger sister who just turned 18. 4 years ago, she started at the same Catholic, uniform wearing high school I attended when I was a teenager; and for 4 years our family has been living in hell. Please bare with me as I recount our experiences and please feel free to offer brutally honest opinions and criticisms because we simply don't know what to do anymore.

My sister, like myself, had always been a good kid. We were raised in a fairly simple and conservative household and instilled with good morals, manners and respect by our parents and neither of us ever posed any problems whatsoever. We are quite different her and I, and these differences really started to show when the problem began: her high school years.

Now for some reason beyond me, my sister has at this point developed an extremely bad attitude and temper. What I mean by that is if she asks for something and my parents say no, or if they don't allow her to go out, etc, for whatever reason; all in all if they say anything in opposition to her...BAM! Out of no where, she shuts down, refusing to speak to them or even acknowledge them! It's almost as if she has an ON/OFF switch. The severity of this has caused situations where she will flat out not speak to ANY of us, and this has gone on sometimes for 5 MONTHS CONSECUTIVELY. Now, I know you may be thinking how this is possible, for someone to not talk to the people they live with for so long, but I'll tell you. During school days, she'd wake up in the morning come downstairs, eat breakfast without a word, hop in my dad's car, shut the door behind him without even saying bye, and head off to school in the mornings. After school and for the rest of the evenings, she'd coop herself up in her room until bed time and the whole routine would start again the next day. On weekends, all day she'd spend in her room, either on her phone or computer. The first thing I'm sure you must be thinking is, ""why the heck don't my parents take her electronics away?"" My parents, lord bless them, are not one for conflict. If anything, after the 5 months of hell they went through when their own child wouldn't look at nor acknowledge them, let alone speak to them, they've been doing everything they can to avoid going back to that place where we really weren't a family, rather 4 individuals living in a house. So because they want to avoid conflict with my ""tit for tat"" sister, (think of someone having a mentality like ""oh, that's what you're going to do? that's what you're going to take from me? well watch what I do to you now b\*\*\*, I'm going to make you regret your decision and hate your life"" this is literally how my sister acts), they allow her to keep her things, they make every effort to go out of their way to talk to her (ex. my mom every day during the 5 month period would bring my sister, literally hand delivery butler service style, breakfast, lunch and dinner to her room and take her dishes back down again, all while trying to talk to her and make conversation; anything to interact with her, but was always met with a cringey silence) and moreover, this is what upsets me the most, they still buy her anything and everything she wants whenever she asks. As I said, my parents just want us to be happy altogether and be a family. I once asked why they let her keep her electronics, to which they replied ""they feel bad for the kid just sitting up in her room all by herself all day everyday not talking to anyone,"" and so they let her have some contact with her friend instead of just sitting by herself. Now to this, I have no big issue, but the next is what bothers me and has even led to my parents and I arguing.

Even when my sister is exhibiting this disgusting behaviour, if one day she comes down and tells (not asks, mind you) my parents ""I need clothes for no uniform day"" or ""i need to buy pants from the mall,"" I'll tell you what, you've never seen anyone move as fast as my mum or dad to take her to buy stuff; they just suck it all up, this attention, and relish in it. I don't know why they do this (maybe a parent can help me with this?). Now, this is the part where I get involved because I hate seeing kindness being manipulated, especially within a family, yet whenever I voice this, I am immediately shot down by both parents (dad particularly).

We are by no means wealthy people. For pete's sake, we're a family of 4 surviving on a sole single person income earned by my father of roughly $40k after taxes (before bills; ex. heat, property tax, electricity etc) each year. However, my parents have managed to give both my sister and I all we have asked during these years. Bare in mind however, I have always known of the state in which we live and so as I got older and drifted further from a little girl wanting her dolls and barbies and what not, so have my asks and wants. I never buy things for myself, stretching clothes and toiletries as far as I can before replacing them; and even then, I buy my clothes from discount outlet stores or when there are super sales at the mall; never going beyond spending $40 bucks on a few items of clothes, knowing not to spend lavishly and be grateful for what I have. I rarely ask for anything and when I do, it is very miniscule. My sister on the other hand, neither knows nor cares it seems, about any of this. Since she started high school, it's almost as if her mission has been to become a real life Regina George (Mean Girls reference) a real life Queen Bee of the school to whom all must admire and bow down to as the most popular, prettiest and ""richest"" girl in school; for what reason, it is beyond me. Due to this however, whenever she manages to ""butter up"" my parents, showing them any sort of attention or affection, she ends up coming home with outfits sometimes UPWARDS OF $200+! This is where my jaw drops and temper flairs. I confront my parents all the time when this happens and lose my SH\*\*\*T primarily because AFTER THEY BUY HER CLOTHES AND DROP THIS MUCH MONEY, THEY COME TO ME WHINING AND COMPLAINING ABOUT MY SISTER AND HOW SHE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT MONEY OR ANYTHING AT ALL!! This is what upsets me because this cycle has happened on and on and on and yet THEY STILL TAKE PART IN IT AND COME TO ME AFTER THEY DO THE DEED! It's so repetitive it makes me sick! Why come to me AFTER you do something and then going back again to do it AGAIN and then AGAIN coming to me to complain???? It makes no sense to me! Where the quarrels between my parents and I begin is here. I love my parents fiercely and will not take sh\*\*t from anyone who tries to take advantage of them or manipulate them- but this is what my sister does. She only talks to them when she WANTS or NEEDS something. I've even witnessed in front of my eyes her cuddling up to my dad after 2 weeks of barely even looking at him let alone speaking to him, and then slyly asking him to take her to the mall. I don't care what anyone says, but this is a manipulation of human feelings and to stand by watching makes me sick. However, whenever I bring this very sentiment up to my parents, I'm met with the various comments: ""Stay out of it,"" ""know your place,"" ""don't be the parent,"" and/or ""it's easy to stand on the side and ridicule, but once you're a parent, I'd like to see how easy it is for you to say these things you're saying now."" Time and time again I try to get my parents to wake up and realize that what they're doing is not helping the situation. They are under the mindset however, that it looks bad on them and must make my sister feel bad when they buy me or let me buy anything I want and never say no to me, all the while protesting constantly what my sister asks for. I've tried to remind them that the reason they let me buy things is because I'm not buying things for hundreds of dollars at a time and seldom even ask for things in the first place, yet they don't seem to grasp this concept, insisting they must be ""fair"" to my sister to, and not make it seem like they favour me over her and never say no to me.

I forgot to add, the cherry on top of alllllll that?\^\^ is that as soon as my parents buy my sister what she wants, SNAP! She immediately goes back to not talking to any of us, again for weeks or months at a time. It's almost as if she loathes all of us and yet no one knows why, breaking her silence only when advantageous for her. As she's gotten older, she's resorted to flat out stealing money from my parents; taking money from my mom's purse without a word or from my dad's kitchen cabinet. There have been times when even my parents have fought between themselves over a missing $40, later discovering neither of them was at fault to begin with.

So far I've covered these bipolar looking experiences and money problems and my ""you say left, I'll go right"" acting sister. What's next is debatable and I have not voiced my opinion on this vocally but I can see how much it upsets my parents- the fact that my sister goes out of her way to sexualize herself, expose herself and get attention from absolutely anyone. This is a girl who just turned 18, in my and my parents eyes, still a kid, but understandable legally considered an adult, I get it. However, is it that bad to say/think that there is a time and a place to dress like you're going to the strip club? Do we not all consider the location of where we're going when deciding what to wear? Not my sister. When I was her age, as I said, I really never cared for my appearance or body, dressing fairly simply anywhere we'd go. Now I'm no hypocrite, I've worn tight dresses and crop tops to college parties and house parties and what not, but thats about it. If heading to a coffee shop or to the mall, a simple t-shirt and jeans was what I'd always stick with. However I can see the look of anxiety and disbelieve on my parents face when my sister comes out of her room wearing pasties and a mesh top or a barely breathable tube top bando...just to walk to the bus stop or roam around downtown in our city which is honestly populated by a lot of old pervs walking around. The worst of these occasions was when we were heading to a religious celebration at church and due to an argument in the car between her and my mom, out of spite (coming to think of it, this is a word I should've used before, it is quite accurate to describe my sister as such; spiteful), she changed into a ridiculously low cut top and extreme push up bra (God knows where she got them from) and started flaunting and prancing about elders, parents and priests, exposing her chest as much as she could. There have been times where my mom has tried to get my dad to tell her to dress more decently but understandably, he has remained silent. I now understand how difficult/awkward it must be for a grown man, a father, to look at his daughter's body and tell her to ""cover up."" With regards to the incident I mentioned above, neither of my parents were present to witness this however others were and passed comments on to me. I am very close with my mom and so I mentioned this to her, asking her again and again not to make this a huge ordeal or risk my sister not speaking to any of us again. However, somehow my sister caught wind of this conversation (both my mom and I feel that somehow she is able to access our Facebook conversations). It was this point that marked the start of my sister going roughly a little over 1 year without speaking to me; 1 year of sharing the same room but turning her face the other way if while sleeping I turned over to face her; 1 year of passing me in the bathroom while brushing teeth and not looking at me; 1 year. I lived abroad for approximately 6 months last year and I'd hoped that in knowing I'd be gone for such a long time, she'd utter even a goodbye to me, but nothing, not even replying hello to me when I returned home...All this due to that damned top and bra. In fact, sometimes when shopping with my mum, she'll tell my sister that she can't buy her certain things due to how expensive they are, etc, to which my sister replies to my mom that if she DOESNT buy her what she wants, she won't talk to me (her sister). Using her silence as a threat almost toward my parents.

Because this has been going on for 4 years, my dad has honestly given up. He no longer tries to get her to talk to him, be overtly nice to her, or even vocally speak out again her questionable choices. His theory? That theres no point in talking to a person that doesn't want help nor to be spoken to. This in particular has let to heated exchanges between my mum, who repeatedly argues with my sister over leaving the house and not returning till 1 a.m., dressing like she's going to the club only to walk around the streets with her friends, taking money without asking, buying things we can't afford; but then witnesses my dad just sitting back and saying nothing. She feels that being the father, by him saying something, my sister would listen. But as I've said, it's as though he has given up on.

I mentioned wayyyyy back above (sorry this post length) that my sister wasn't always like this; that she used to be a sweet little innocent kid. However we've recently discovered that her friends might be responsible for influencing her to be a disrespectful, impressionable and attention seeking Queen B. In something as simple as a year book, my mum was shocked to see comments encouraging my sister to try to have as much sex as possible when she leaves for university; comments telling her to continue to ""be a hoe,"" to ""get some di\*k (in her/in her mouth)"" ""flash her great t\*ts"" and so on and so forth. To be honest, I'm not quite sure the relevance of this anymore, but we do feel that her friends have definitely influenced her negatively and that due to all the attention they give her and all the comments they pass about her face and body, that she continues to be with them. As I said, she loves the attention but is seemingly not smart in terms of the people she chooses to associate with. I honestly don't know why or how in this day and age, teens have nothing else to talk about except vulgarity and to such excess to the point where its the ONLY thing they seem to talk about.

Honestly, so much has happened with in a year that I cannot even remember all of it to mention here, but this all pretty much sums it all up for now. She is leaving for college in about a month where she'll be living on campus but regardless, can anyone shed light on this? Provide any insight or encouragement or even similar experiences dealing with a teenage girl like this? I can confidently say that it breaks my parents hearts

\#tldr","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New to reddit, but a friend suggested I try this since my parents and I have run out of options. I am currently in my early 20s with a younger sister who just turned 18. 4 years ago, she started at the same Catholic, uniform wearing high school I attended when I was a teenager; and for 4 years our family has been living in hell. Please bare with me as I recount our experiences and please feel free to offer brutally honest opinions and criticisms because we simply don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sister, like myself, had always been a good kid. We were raised in a fairly simple and conservative household and instilled with good morals, manners and respect by our parents and neither of us ever posed any problems whatsoever. We are quite different her and I, and these differences really started to show when the problem began: her high school years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for some reason beyond me, my sister has at this point developed an extremely bad attitude and temper. What I mean by that is if she asks for something and my parents say no, or if they don&amp;#39;t allow her to go out, etc, for whatever reason; all in all if they say anything in opposition to her...BAM! Out of no where, she shuts down, refusing to speak to them or even acknowledge them! It&amp;#39;s almost as if she has an ON/OFF switch. The severity of this has caused situations where she will flat out not speak to ANY of us, and this has gone on sometimes for 5 MONTHS CONSECUTIVELY. Now, I know you may be thinking how this is possible, for someone to not talk to the people they live with for so long, but I&amp;#39;ll tell you. During school days, she&amp;#39;d wake up in the morning come downstairs, eat breakfast without a word, hop in my dad&amp;#39;s car, shut the door behind him without even saying bye, and head off to school in the mornings. After school and for the rest of the evenings, she&amp;#39;d coop herself up in her room until bed time and the whole routine would start again the next day. On weekends, all day she&amp;#39;d spend in her room, either on her phone or computer. The first thing I&amp;#39;m sure you must be thinking is, &amp;quot;why the heck don&amp;#39;t my parents take her electronics away?&amp;quot; My parents, lord bless them, are not one for conflict. If anything, after the 5 months of hell they went through when their own child wouldn&amp;#39;t look at nor acknowledge them, let alone speak to them, they&amp;#39;ve been doing everything they can to avoid going back to that place where we really weren&amp;#39;t a family, rather 4 individuals living in a house. So because they want to avoid conflict with my &amp;quot;tit for tat&amp;quot; sister, (think of someone having a mentality like &amp;quot;oh, that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re going to do? that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re going to take from me? well watch what I do to you now b***, I&amp;#39;m going to make you regret your decision and hate your life&amp;quot; this is literally how my sister acts), they allow her to keep her things, they make every effort to go out of their way to talk to her (ex. my mom every day during the 5 month period would bring my sister, literally hand delivery butler service style, breakfast, lunch and dinner to her room and take her dishes back down again, all while trying to talk to her and make conversation; anything to interact with her, but was always met with a cringey silence) and moreover, this is what upsets me the most, they still buy her anything and everything she wants whenever she asks. As I said, my parents just want us to be happy altogether and be a family. I once asked why they let her keep her electronics, to which they replied &amp;quot;they feel bad for the kid just sitting up in her room all by herself all day everyday not talking to anyone,&amp;quot; and so they let her have some contact with her friend instead of just sitting by herself. Now to this, I have no big issue, but the next is what bothers me and has even led to my parents and I arguing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when my sister is exhibiting this disgusting behaviour, if one day she comes down and tells (not asks, mind you) my parents &amp;quot;I need clothes for no uniform day&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;i need to buy pants from the mall,&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;ll tell you what, you&amp;#39;ve never seen anyone move as fast as my mum or dad to take her to buy stuff; they just suck it all up, this attention, and relish in it. I don&amp;#39;t know why they do this (maybe a parent can help me with this?). Now, this is the part where I get involved because I hate seeing kindness being manipulated, especially within a family, yet whenever I voice this, I am immediately shot down by both parents (dad particularly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are by no means wealthy people. For pete&amp;#39;s sake, we&amp;#39;re a family of 4 surviving on a sole single person income earned by my father of roughly $40k after taxes (before bills; ex. heat, property tax, electricity etc) each year. However, my parents have managed to give both my sister and I all we have asked during these years. Bare in mind however, I have always known of the state in which we live and so as I got older and drifted further from a little girl wanting her dolls and barbies and what not, so have my asks and wants. I never buy things for myself, stretching clothes and toiletries as far as I can before replacing them; and even then, I buy my clothes from discount outlet stores or when there are super sales at the mall; never going beyond spending $40 bucks on a few items of clothes, knowing not to spend lavishly and be grateful for what I have. I rarely ask for anything and when I do, it is very miniscule. My sister on the other hand, neither knows nor cares it seems, about any of this. Since she started high school, it&amp;#39;s almost as if her mission has been to become a real life Regina George (Mean Girls reference) a real life Queen Bee of the school to whom all must admire and bow down to as the most popular, prettiest and &amp;quot;richest&amp;quot; girl in school; for what reason, it is beyond me. Due to this however, whenever she manages to &amp;quot;butter up&amp;quot; my parents, showing them any sort of attention or affection, she ends up coming home with outfits sometimes UPWARDS OF $200+! This is where my jaw drops and temper flairs. I confront my parents all the time when this happens and lose my SH***T primarily because AFTER THEY BUY HER CLOTHES AND DROP THIS MUCH MONEY, THEY COME TO ME WHINING AND COMPLAINING ABOUT MY SISTER AND HOW SHE DOESN&amp;#39;T CARE ABOUT MONEY OR ANYTHING AT ALL!! This is what upsets me because this cycle has happened on and on and on and yet THEY STILL TAKE PART IN IT AND COME TO ME AFTER THEY DO THE DEED! It&amp;#39;s so repetitive it makes me sick! Why come to me AFTER you do something and then going back again to do it AGAIN and then AGAIN coming to me to complain???? It makes no sense to me! Where the quarrels between my parents and I begin is here. I love my parents fiercely and will not take sh**t from anyone who tries to take advantage of them or manipulate them- but this is what my sister does. She only talks to them when she WANTS or NEEDS something. I&amp;#39;ve even witnessed in front of my eyes her cuddling up to my dad after 2 weeks of barely even looking at him let alone speaking to him, and then slyly asking him to take her to the mall. I don&amp;#39;t care what anyone says, but this is a manipulation of human feelings and to stand by watching makes me sick. However, whenever I bring this very sentiment up to my parents, I&amp;#39;m met with the various comments: &amp;quot;Stay out of it,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;know your place,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t be the parent,&amp;quot; and/or &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s easy to stand on the side and ridicule, but once you&amp;#39;re a parent, I&amp;#39;d like to see how easy it is for you to say these things you&amp;#39;re saying now.&amp;quot; Time and time again I try to get my parents to wake up and realize that what they&amp;#39;re doing is not helping the situation. They are under the mindset however, that it looks bad on them and must make my sister feel bad when they buy me or let me buy anything I want and never say no to me, all the while protesting constantly what my sister asks for. I&amp;#39;ve tried to remind them that the reason they let me buy things is because I&amp;#39;m not buying things for hundreds of dollars at a time and seldom even ask for things in the first place, yet they don&amp;#39;t seem to grasp this concept, insisting they must be &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot; to my sister to, and not make it seem like they favour me over her and never say no to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forgot to add, the cherry on top of alllllll that?^^ is that as soon as my parents buy my sister what she wants, SNAP! She immediately goes back to not talking to any of us, again for weeks or months at a time. It&amp;#39;s almost as if she loathes all of us and yet no one knows why, breaking her silence only when advantageous for her. As she&amp;#39;s gotten older, she&amp;#39;s resorted to flat out stealing money from my parents; taking money from my mom&amp;#39;s purse without a word or from my dad&amp;#39;s kitchen cabinet. There have been times when even my parents have fought between themselves over a missing $40, later discovering neither of them was at fault to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;#39;ve covered these bipolar looking experiences and money problems and my &amp;quot;you say left, I&amp;#39;ll go right&amp;quot; acting sister. What&amp;#39;s next is debatable and I have not voiced my opinion on this vocally but I can see how much it upsets my parents- the fact that my sister goes out of her way to sexualize herself, expose herself and get attention from absolutely anyone.

It’s 3:32am and this mama is tired. I have an almost 2 month old. I don’t breastfeed. At first, my husband would get up with me at Night, but for the past month he doesn’t. My baby sleeps from about 10/11pm to 3ish am for a feeding/ diaper change  , then off to bed again. Not bad, I know I can’t complain about that. However, somehow it has become solely my job to get up with her. It’s not like I’m the only one who can feed and change her since she’s formula fed. But for some reason but my husband has just decided I would take care of it. Which I do because that’s my baby. So yesterday I told him I’d like for him to start splitting night time feedings with me. I told him I didn’t think it was fair that the responsibility has been put fully  on me. I didn’t mind at first because he had a job where he worked 3am - 10 am. But recently he lost his job and doesn’t have to be there anymore (obviously). And yes he’s looking for a new job ASAP. Well I work evenings as a server. So I can sleep in where the baby lets me. My question is, so I have a right to be annoyed that he doesn’t trade off with me at night? Hell, if he would even take 2 or 3 nights a weeks I’d be thrilled by. I love my daughter and taking care of her, but he is just as capable. He’s a great dad but just assumes that at night I have her. On top of that I’d do 80% the work all day when he was working to allow him to sleep for work. Now he’s jobless and I’m not. I feel he needs to be getting up with her and switching me off. I confronted him last night and he agreed that he needed to start doing so. Well 3am rolls around, she wakes up (and she’s LOUD) and he doesn’t budge. So of course I get her because I’m not letting my baby be hungry. I wake him up to hold her and calm her until I make her bottle. And he does, but does it mostly asleep. As soon as the bottle is made I’m given the baby and he goes straight back to sleep. So once again I have to feed and change her by myself while he sleeps. And it’s not like he has to work. Especially since we talked about it hours before. Am I a bitch for being annoyed? Yes I could have probably insisted he wake up and all but he’s a bear to wake up and I was already doing it. How do I get him to start taking initiative and switching off without me having to make him do it and cause irritation between us? I’m just frustrated. He’s a good dad, but I’m so sick of being the only one at night and taking care of 75% of things during the day now even. On top of all this I reacted very level headed and kind about him losing his job. Just insisted he get one ASAP and he agreed. And I promise you when 7/8 rolls around I’ll be the one up again. And then I’ll be in charge until whenever he wakes up. Then I’ll go to work. I don’t want to be rude and I don’t want to argue, but damn it doesn’t seem like a lot to ask. He wanted a baby bad and now he has one. So I guess long random, and probably hard to follow because I’m literally falling asleep writing this; how do I get him to do equal work without attacking him or forcing  him up in. He’s a good dad so please don’t talk crap on him. I just want  some helpful advice. TIA.

The story is incredibly complex and starts from many many years ago. I will try to condense this as much as possible to get to today. 

 My sister was molested by her step father (my father ) when she was ~5, she is now 21. My mom left him when this came to light.  Following this , my mom, myself,  and 3 siblings ( each sibling except 2 has a different dad , total 3 dads in the mix )have had a life of psychological trauma  and never really got the appropriate help we needed for multiple reasons  ( denial , ignorance , money , bad parenting). My sister, like i,  was basically raised by my grandma (shes toxic as well) and she has also had a strained relationship with her own bio father , and men in general over the years (despite him being trying to be present in her life ).  In her late teens , starting college , she was living with my mom and was going to university had a good job, had friends, and we had a good relationship. She was always pretty positive , kind , ambitious , etc. For what feels something that happened over night , she became a complete stranger.  she started compulsively lying , flunked out of college for never showing up, got into hallucinogens, decided to pursue more artistic but unrealistic avenues of income ( making jewelry and music despite never learning an instrument) , she would come home to my moms at ungodly hours stoned and reeking of weed with my &lt;10yoa brother noticing. She did this with the excuse that she was living her own life and trying to find herself without our disapproval... During this ,  she was attached to the hip with her ""best friend"" robert. Over time a really unhealthy codependent and psychologically abusive relationship developed between the two and she slowly started spending more and more time at his place until she basically transitioned full time living with him and his parents. Robert has a very "" the world is against me "" mentality and its clear my sister has basically become him, from wearing his clothes , to going against everyone and lashing out to whoever says anything against robert. They have physically fought , hes broken her phone , shes cut ties with us under the pretense that we dont support her and dont want to accept Robert nor help him overcome his adversities because his parents wont. Every little job shes gotten she HAS to get Robert a job there too. And if he couldn't get a job he would wait for her "" keeping her company"" at her job. 

During this time we ( my mom her bio dad and me) had to do detective work to figure out where she was staying ( we were concerned she was lying about where she lived, how she ate , how she supported herself because she refused to tell us anything ) , we figured it out and her parents met up with Roberts parents to discuss things. Basically everyone was just as fucked and confused and worried about the relationship betweem them  . Turns out she was sleeping on the floor in his closet (didnt share his bed ) she wasnt eating ( but would steal food from my mom depsite her having every opportunity to come home to my moms ) she was shop lifting , stealing etc. We begged her to come home ( shes 18 at this time ) and she refused. We offer to meet robert and have multiple dinners and basically kill them with kindness ... No avail. Multiple multiple times she's offered therapy offered doctors appts offered every opportunity and she still refuses because again she wants to do it on her own and refuses to go unless Robert gets help too and basically holds us accountable for his support and mental health. She has gone to my moms on and off whenever her and Robert have fought with robert stalking her outside and her anxiously emailing him about her whereabouts. And depsite our efforts to love and support her she shits on us and goes back to robert. 
Last month roberts parents kicked her out because they had enough. She had the option to go to her dads or my moms. She went to my moms. She snuck Robert in one day to do his laundry , my mom is not comfortable with robert in the house , my other sister (B) was the only one home. She (B) called my mom to tell her robert was in the house and after my mom called back my sister(A) to confirm a vicious physical fight occured between them with robert egging and taunting the fight over the fact that Robert was a Guest and that we should treat him as such... ( shes basically a Guest as well ) . this caused severe strain between everyone in the house because my mom is stuck between condoning violence and lying to help sister A while also validating and supporting sister B that was attacked.  In a months span  , sister A has purposely keyed sister B car and admitted to the cops that she did it because she hates sister B.  She has stolen from my moms cc for uber and lyft rides. She is furious my mom wont lend her the car.  
Additionally , my brothers dad ( different from abused sisters dad and my bio dad ) goes over on the weekends to watch my brother...she has started to threaten everyone with calling the cops and saying he is molesting her. She is saying my mom wants what happened to her as a child with my bio dad to happen again with bros dad. She also says these things to my brother. My mom has tried to calm and reason her but she continues the threats, he hasn't done anything to her btw. 

My mom is not a perfect person. Honestly shes made terrible decisions at the cost of her childrens respect and love . But a lot has gotten better and changed for the good during the time my sister was living with robert and had cut us off.   

From my perspective I think my sister is still living in the past and is reliving trauma but refuses to seek help and is finding every possible way to take out her anger and mistrust on everyone around her despite us just wanting to help. If we help she still says she doesnt want anything , but she continues to be incredibly disrespectful manipulative and aggressive. My mom has tried to lay boundaries and expectations as my sister is basically a roommate by her own choice in moms home . My other sister and brother feel suffocated and are scared shes going to lash out on them. Her bio dad has basically given up and lets my mom deal with it because he knows my mom will never say no to her. My mom is stuck between letting her stay and continue disrupting  home vs sending her to her dads. She's tried so much but my sister is both in need of desperate psychological help but also burning all the bridges that lead to support. She doesn't want to kick her out because we want to help... But she's also stealing from my mom (who is BROKE ) and calling the cops for no reason and vandalizing their property. They have gone from trauma to improvement back to trauma. Everyone is fucked in this story and the one who really can do anything is my mom. We want my sister to wake up but we also dont want her to feel like shes unwanted , shes just making it really difficult to both support her and forgive her for shitting on us and using us whenever Robert and her fought. She's mad at us for her past but won't acknowledge today's efforts. The cop even told her if she hates living with my mom so much she can leave because shes of age and that she was in an abusive relationship that she refuses to see. She doesn't want to go to school either and recently got a retail job but its hard cuz she has no car or money and its tough to trust her because of the stealing and the times shes used the car to see robert. 

I know its hard to follow this story... Its so so so complicated but this is the best I can do given the time .

Me(24F)  &amp; my kids dad(23M) Were only together for close to a year before I  got pregnant with our son. We ended up splitting about a month before he  was born. Our relationship wasn't the greatest, he worked fast food  &amp; never tried to better himself for our family, had multiple  opportunities he missed out on. Basically he was just lazy &amp; didn't  wanna grow up. Although I wasn't perfect either, I was an unpleasant  person to be around when I was pregnant, everything he did would annoy  me I couldn't stand being around him. He started dating a young girl he  worked with, i knew who she was he had tried to date her while we were  together, not a very faithful dude to say the least. When they started  dating he was still involved with our son.  He loved our son so much, I  think he genuinely enjoyed being a dad. But them dating enraged me with  jealousy. I messaged her basically going off calling her a homewrecker.  she broke up with him months later &amp; he blamed me, i hadn't talked  to her for months.

We started up  again,  We ""tried"" at having the family we both wanted. Resulted in a  domestic dispute. About a week after I found out i was pregnant again,  he blamed it all on me. A while back He gave me money to buy a plan B, I  was already pregnant at the time &amp; didnt know yet. He didnt want  anything to do with the baby or my pregnancy. 6/7 months into my  pregnancy he comes back &amp; we start again, not smart, but we enjoyed  it. Did that up until our daughter was born, said the whole time he  would help with the her. When she came he demanded a paternity test.

I  did everything for my family, got our own apartment &amp; got a great  job, go to school &amp; provide my kids with everything they could need  without his help. He still works at fast food &amp; started dating his  boss when our daughter was born, which changed him for the worst. I was  never jealous of this relationship, i told him i was happy for them  &amp; didnt mind if she be around our kids. I was never rude to her or  anything of the sort. he only wanted to see our son &amp; not our other  child. I knew he could be a good dad so i kept pushing them on him &amp;  force him to see the both of them on visitation days. not letting him  choose one over the other, which resulted in him surrendering them to  his sister &amp; her trying to take custody of my kids Which did not  happen.  I had never been so mad &amp; hurt by him, he knew how hard i  work for them but he sat in a court room &amp; lied about how im an  ""unfit"" mother. After, I made him follow the state law telling his  gf(with 4 yr old son) that she cant live or stay at his house with my  kids untill they are married what they do when my kids are not around is  their business. He said that b/c of my actions he doesnt want anything  to do with our kids &amp; that he will do what he wants. Although i do  have a habit of blowing up his phone when he ignores me.

I for one wouldn't do it through a traditional lense but rather a rational one. I would be a rational, understanding, open minded parent who gives freedom but with regulation (to prevent chaos).  Here are the rules I'd have for my children:

-Treat me with kindness and I will do the same to them (no double standards)

-They have self respect for themselves (nothing that will hurt themselves or make them stupid)

-Let them have a boyfriend/girlfriend but have rules around it to ensure they are safe (until they're 18)

-Make friends with whoever they want as long as they are not being manipulated or badly influenced

-Get good grades and concentrate on school (Preferrably As and Bs, but I wouldn't be mad over a C)

-Allow them to go out to parties (including drinking) as long as they are doing it safely, responsibly, moderately and as as sensibly as possible.

-Make sure they don't deceive others for personal gain

I will not post all the details of why but it has to happen. I work full time from a home office. So I appear to my child to always be on the computer, this worries me too. This not so much now that school is back in, but I haven’t addressed the divorce with him yet either, I filed and asked him to leave the him just in late July. Divorce is final sept 6.

I have no doubt that divorce can effect a 6 year old negatively. I fought to save this marriage to end up having exposed this crazy behaviors to my child for even longer. So I have no doubt the divorce was the lesser of the evils.    How do I make sure he understand what’s Happening with divorce. 

also how to I keep him from feeling like I am always on the computer too. I have to work to make ends meet, more than ever now that I am full custody and functioning on one income. 

I have gathered he blames me. Heard him say a few times I won’t let dad come home. I can’t really argue anything with him. I would rather he blame me than himself.

The ex is a vile human and a loser but he never has been hatful with the child or out him on direct danger. Also in the custody agreement I am by law to allow him visitation. 

So I am being torn in every direction and my main focus is always my child’s mental Heath and having a peaceful loving home.  

I am not even sure how to explain we are divorcing. 

My child had a nightmare last year, it really freaked him out he talked about it for weeks and told his school teacher, 
it was about his parents splitting up!

Born to parents who were plagued by the temptations of drugs and chaos in life. The parents were deemed unfit and the child was removed from their care while at the hospital. The child was also born with a mild dependency to the drugs his mother had used during her pregnancy. The child made a remarkable recovery and the day he left the hospital, no one could tell that he had been a newborn dependent on any drugs.\n\nThe child’s father was a kind soul before he got mixed up with the wrong crowd and made a couple wrong life decisions. He came from a loving family, a tight knit group of folk who lived the simple life of working to provide for their families. This newborn, though technically parentless, had an entire loving paternal family that wanted to get to know him, a family full of uncles, aunts, grandparents, great uncles and great uncles, cousins, everyone. Most importantly, the child had a loving uncle who wanted to care for him. In the child’s favor, he was related to this uncle, but maybe not in his favor, the uncle was in a same sex marriage and maybe thats what took this case into the far depths of wrongness. The child’s uncles were ready to bring him home the day he left the hospital to care for him, to raise him as their own.\n\nInstead, the child was sent to foster care. He landed in a home promised to be housing his half siblings (same mother but different fathers). Indeed, these siblings would have provided a good support system, but instead, the siblings left that foster home 1 week after the child was placed. Oregon refused to consider kinship care or a family resource even when the child’s uncles were readily available to bring him home. Oregon opted to use government funds on a child who had family that wanted him rather than spend the money towards a child that had no one around, who had no family. They kept this child in foster care, paid this foster family to keep the child in an unknown home, and actively kept the child away from his very capable paternal family and gay uncles.\n\nAfter 2 years of fighting and reaching out to simply meet their nephew, the couple was finally registered as a certified foster home. The delay of 2 years was due to active refusal of Oregon to supply the necessary paperwork for the couple’s home to be approved. The delay also came between the 3 different social workers that were removed and reassigned to the case due to the prior one’s inadequacies.\xa0\n\nAfter years of constant barraging of DHS, the uncles were finally able to meet their nephew for the first time… not because DHS allowed it, but rather in court where the uncles were not even informed about but had to find out about it by their hired lawyer. The social worker for the case opted to not tell the uncles of the majority of court dates over the years in hopes to defile the gay couple’s image in front of the judge and in front of their own nephew. After DHS had actively kept the uncles from seeing their nephew, now the argument is the child has bonded and lived with the foster family for too long to be removed from their home.\xa0\n\nNow, the system has turned the tables and blames the gay uncles for not fighting hard enough, for not speaking up enough, for being in a same sex marriage that caused the lengthy permancy of this child. The numerous saved emails over the last 2.5 years between the couple and DHS say otherwise. Everything they could do was financially limited and maybe that is why it was not enough for DHS to reunite the uncles with their nephew. The couple hired a lawyer who was restricted within his jurisdiction. They reached out to the Oregon Governor’s Advocacy who had to replace the acting social worker on this case 3 times and still nothing changed with each worker. They offered to take their nephew home from the beginning with no strings attached, no need for monthly stipends, no need for governmental assistance, no need for unnecessary resources being used for a child who had loving family.\n\nToday on 8/21/2019, 2.5 years later the news was finalized, the foster family was given the official rights to adopt this child because DHS had kept him in this home and never considered the child’s own uncles as a resource home. It was finalized that this child will never get to know his paternal family even if they lived down the street. It was finalized that it was another step away from this loving gay couple to have children of their own. They weren’t even allowed to bring home their own blood nephew, let alone another foster child of no relation. This fight was a damper for the family. The child’s paternal side mourned this loss. This fight was absolutely a step back for true family values, a violation of the supposed “reuniting families as a priority” motto, and a slap in the face for LGBTQ+ families who are able and willing to raise a loving family.

A little backstory, me and a guy friend who I’d liked for a while went to prom together and really hit it off and continued going on infrequent dates over the summer. I’m not sure if I would call him my boyfriend, but it’s pretty close (we’ve kissed, gone on dates, all that teenager stuff). But he’s going off to college next week and we have to decide if we’ll be staying together or not (a whole different issue; I’m worried here about my parents’ reaction)

My parents have always been the somewhat overprotective type even though I’m 17 soon to be 18. I can’t go to other people’s houses if parents aren’t home, can’t go out late unless there’s a special situation, etc. My mom has loosened up but my dad remains very strict (my mom usually tells him about my plans for me so she can do it in a way for him to agree to them). Thing is, with this guy, they let me do whatever I want. They’ve never called it dating and I honestly can’t tell if they know or if they just think we’re good friends. They know we slow danced at prom but I never told them about us admitting to having feelings simply because they never asked. Id be happy to share but don’t want to unnecessarily incriminate myself. All my mom does is kinda check if parents will be home (this is the woman who would call other parents to confirm; she just flat out doesn’t with his) and ask if any “shenanigans” will be happening (I don’t consider kissing in this category but she probably does. Again, she never asked if we kissed so I haven’t told)

I’ll have to explain the whole college situation very soon, and, if I were a parent I would interpret what I’ve been doing as dating but I genuinely can’t tell if she thinks we’re dating or doesn’t want to acknowledge it or whatever. Parents, she knows, right? It’s just weird that my parents often talk down about teenage relationships but they’re BOTH fine with this (makes me think they don’t realize what it is, but they never asked when they usually ask a million questions)

Not too sure what my actual question here is, but I guess should I clarify what’s going on before I talk to him about continuing the relationship or just leave it as it is and have them find out when he comes to visit later? Normally I can read them but this is so out of character I’m at a loss on what to do. 

That was a lot but thank you for reading!!

TL;DR Can’t tell if my parents know if I’m dating this guy and are acting beyond out of character; want to know whether I should clarify or not before starting an LDR which would likely involve visiting him/him visiting me.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello parents of reddit,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little backstory, me and a guy friend who I’d liked for a while went to prom together and really hit it off and continued going on infrequent dates over the summer. I’m not sure if I would call him my boyfriend, but it’s pretty close (we’ve kissed, gone on dates, all that teenager stuff). But he’s going off to college next week and we have to decide if we’ll be staying together or not (a whole different issue; I’m worried here about my parents’ reaction)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents have always been the somewhat overprotective type even though I’m 17 soon to be 18. I can’t go to other people’s houses if parents aren’t home, can’t go out late unless there’s a special situation, etc. My mom has loosened up but my dad remains very strict (my mom usually tells him about my plans for me so she can do it in a way for him to agree to them). Thing is, with this guy, they let me do whatever I want. They’ve never called it dating and I honestly can’t tell if they know or if they just think we’re good friends. They know we slow danced at prom but I never told them about us admitting to having feelings simply because they never asked. Id be happy to share but don’t want to unnecessarily incriminate myself. All my mom does is kinda check if parents will be home (this is the woman who would call other parents to confirm; she just flat out doesn’t with his) and ask if any “shenanigans” will be happening (I don’t consider kissing in this category but she probably does. Again, she never asked if we kissed so I haven’t told)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll have to explain the whole college situation very soon, and, if I were a parent I would interpret what I’ve been doing as dating but I genuinely can’t tell if she thinks we’re dating or doesn’t want to acknowledge it or whatever. Parents, she knows, right? It’s just weird that my parents often talk down about teenage relationships but they’re BOTH fine with this (makes me think they don’t realize what it is, but they never asked when they usually ask a million questions)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not too sure what my actual question here is, but I guess should I clarify what’s going on before I talk to him about continuing the relationship or just leave it as it is and have them find out when he comes to visit later? Normally I can read them but this is so out of character I’m at a loss on what to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a lot but thank you for reading!!&lt;/p&gt;

We went to court just before I turned 8 and I told the court reporter that I wanted to spend all the time with my dad because I spend all my time with him even when they were together and that I didn’t enjoy being alone with my mum. 

Turns out the court reporter used to work for the same company my mum did so she put in the report that my parents should have split custody. I didn’t like this and really didn’t enjoy being at my mums. It started getting worse as whenever I mentioned my dad she would get annoyed and scream at me etc. Even if all I did was say “I went swimming with my dad this weekend” she would start going off on one.

When I was about 6 my parents got a mortgage on a 4 bedroom house and I am their only child and we had a poodle. My dad and I were still staying in the house after my parents split and as my mum had the bigger salary she was paying the mortgage and threatened my dad saying that if we didn’t move out in 2 months that she would stop paying the mortgage. We managed to find a flat to rent a few streets down the road so I was still near my friends within less than 2 months. She still stopped paying the mortgage and didn’t move in (she was staying at my grandparents in a town 20 minutes away which meant I had to stay there when I had “her time”). My mother and I moved in about 6 months after I’d moved out with my dad and she still hadn’t paid the mortgage in those 6 months(I believe) the bank said that they had to sell the house or it would be repossessed. They got an offer on the house but was significantly below the asking price and one day we(my mother and I) walked past the person who supposedly put the offer on the house with the dog. My mum turned to me and said (before I knew the house was being sold)“that’s the person who put an offer in for the house and your dad rejected it” in a very nasty tone, then looked up at the person as we approached and smiled and waved and said hi. I later found out the bank was the one that rejected the offer. 

As well as all this going on, my dad had gotten me a phone for my 8th birthday as he was worried he wouldn’t be able to contact me while I was at my mums and we missed eachother a lot as he was always the one to put me to bed and we would frequently read books together. So he also wanted to say goodnight etc, but every day my mum would take my phone off me and once we were driving to my grandparents (while mum was still living there) from school and she hit me as she saw me texting my dad saying “I love you”. It wasn’t a full on hit but she slapped my leg and I’d never been hit before. 

After a while we went back to court and I had to stay with her 5 days throughout every 2 weeks. I was very glad as I felt this was more what I wanted. A year or two later it got down to 4 nights out of the 2 weeks. During these years I was given plenty of reasons to want this, including the ongoing regular speeches of how my dad should die and go to hell. Another thing that happened was my dad would regularly make sure I called my mum and talk to her (knowing no contact would be used against him) but for a couple months she wouldn’t answer, over the summer my mum and I stayed in a campervan with my Aunt and Uncle (who to that point had no problem with my dad) and my cousin’s. She took my phone off me and blocked her own number. On the second day she approached my uncle while I was there and said something along the lines of “I’ve been trying to call (me) over the past few weeks but it won’t go through” (at this point I’m confused watching what is happening) she continues “can you have a look at her phone (presents my phone as if she took it off me to check this out) I can’t figure it out”. Of course my uncle knowing quite a bit about electronics and technology etc goes straight to the blocked list and immediately finds my mums number is blocked. I’m really confused at this point as I’ve been trying to call her but don’t say anything out of fear for my mum and feel ashamed and confused. She then suggested it was my dad and since then my uncle doesn’t speak to my dad. 

Fast forward a few years to high school. I’m 12 and FYI I live in Scotland. I start high school having been bullied by people I thought were my friends 2 years previous and thought I had a good friend, her best friend just so happens to be a complete b**ch to me but I deal with it, gradually getting better friends and becoming more confident so I tell my mum, at the end of first year, in February before I turn 13 that I was struggling taking my stuff between houses (as she refused to let me take stuff back to my dads during “her time” and had to take 2 days worth of stuff to school every day I went to hers) so I’d like to see her a little less. At the time I was seeing her on the Thursday night of the first week and from Friday night to Monday morning of the following week (4 days out of 14). What I suggest was that I see my mother (who had been in and out of different houses but now lived 2 hours away so whenever I was “at hers” I was actually at my grandparents) on the Friday after school as usual and would go home late (8 or 9pm) on the Sunday night to my dads so I was closer to school and stuff. She went off on one at me and screamed and shouted and said how she thought my dad was manipulating me and turning me against her. My grandparents are deaf so didn’t hear this or understand necessarily what was happening. We had dinner and I was still distraught and granny kept asking me what was wrong etc. Mum kept dismissing it before I had a chance to answer. After dinner she started going off at me again so I put my shoes on, grabbed a hoodie and my school bag (phone now allowed to be kept on me). I walked out the house and round the corner and called my dad, he said he’d be there as fast as he could. 5 minutes later my grandad (who I love and adore insanely) came out with the rest of my stuff that I needed and said he loved me and just hugged me. He briefly tried to talk me back in but understood how upset I was and how adamant I was that I was going to my dads. He just stood there hugging me while I cried and waited for my dad. Eventually dad got there and I didn’t talk to my mum for a couple weeks. After this she text me asking to see me and I agreed, we went to coffee shop in the middle of the town somewhere where it was easy to get away from her and soon after we sit down she starts saying stuff like “clearly you just don’t want to see me” etc with me obviously pointing out that’s not true. She then goes on to say how she thinks it better if she doesn’t see me until I’m 21 and she’s in tears so I give her a hug and leave. 

She text me a week before my birthday (about a month after I walked out of my grandparents) asking if she could see me on my birthday, I said I couldn’t as I was already planning on going out for dinner with a large group of my dads family. I suggested meeting up later in the week and asked to go to my grandparents and have one of my granny’s home cooked meals and perhaps have some family round (I’m a big family person). She text back saying something like “no. Why are you being so demanding. We’ll go to bowling and go to (restaurant) afterwards with your aunt and uncle and granny and grandad”. I said ok and I had an alright time although fairly awkward with a few suggestions I should see her more often. That year I saw her 3 more times as it was now on my terms. 4 years later I now see her about 5-8 times a year and she has stopped the abusive words about my dad. I never stay at her house or my grandparents anymore and since then have only stayed 1 night in a house with my aunt and uncle and her and 3 days with her and my bf (although I had to stay in the same room as my mum as I was only 16). 

Now I have 3 questions I’d like answered:

He still gets to watch TV, but he is not nearly as hooked, and is able to better manage his time with it. The side effect however is that he is now obsessed with wanting to make his own show. He asks if he &amp;quot;can be on the tablet?&amp;quot; Meaning he wants to have a show that other kids can watch on their tablets. Do I let him? At least its a more creative avenue than simply watching. Should I just fake it? What do you guys think?&lt;/p&gt;

She knows maybe 30-40 words and if she is shouting ""I want, I want"" in a store, for instance (which is what she is doing this week), it is not really possible to say something like ""please use an inside voice or we will have to leave"" This is just one example but for almost every behavior, it is hard to express a behavior/consequence link that she will really understand.

In school she is very quiet, has trouble asking for things, and is very anxious about other people and the lunch room.

They've tried rewards, taking privileges away, and are in the process of trying to get another therapist (as we had moved last year for my dad's job)

So I am having an issue with my husband. It’s mainly money, life’s ups and downs, and just a general disliking for each other currently. Of course, we are adults so this kind of thing happens. We usually get back on our feet and it’s nothing. But in the last few weeks our fights have turned into us actually yelling at each other, and sadly a few times our kids (all under 12) have been around to hear it. 

Today was a particularly bad argument. While it ended with us planning to go to couples counseling and a happy resolve, it didn’t leave our kids feeling the same as they only saw the fighting and back and forward. I usually know what to say to them, but i think the last few ‘disagreements’ have gotten the best of them.

I am not a parent. I am the 22-year-old aunt of a 14-year-old nephew (turns 15 at the end of Sept.).

A little bit about my nephew: he does have mental issues. He can sometimes have severe anger issues that can result in violent tantrums, but these have been few and far between since he started high school last year. He has s apparently on the autism spectrum (which he has admitted) although his mother refuses to get him officially tested. (As far as \_mental\_ health is concerned she's pretty neglectful.)

I'm unsure of the kinds of friends he hangs out with. He has openly and proudly admitted to watching porn (I don't take issue with this; I assume it something that most if not all teenaged boys would do). I don't know what kind he watches. He plays a lot of video games, and although he does have a few friends, he's generally socially isolated. He is around a lot of women and has been around them most of his life. I would say he has only had 2 significant male family members in his life (father, grandfather).

But now to the question: He talks about rape, lightly, quite frequently and at very surprising times. Nothing about a conversation would even be remotely related to a crime let alone rape. I think this only happens around his family; he tends to treat his friends more respectfully than his family members. But if someone mentions a woman or doing something, he'll say something like ""Oh is she gonna get raped&gt;?!"" The tone he takes when he's usually saying it is very light and funny. Or we'll be watching a show or movie where it is very clear that nothing like sexual assault is going to happen and he'll say something like ""Oh!! He's gonna rape her!"" Or I'll be talking about going somewhere and he says ""What if you get raped,"" but not in a ""I fear for your safety way."" I can't describe it. I have never spent a day with him where he hasn't brought up some out of the blue comment related to rape. And it's always that word: rape. It's never ""sexual assault"" or any other synonym or euphemism for it.

I and my other sister have asked him multiple times what his obsession is with rape and he never answers. I have made it very clear to him that rape is a crime and have even said that it is very important that you understand that rape is serious and a crime and should not be taken lightly. He never talks about his own interjections. His only mentions of rape are like what I have described above.

I don't know what to do about this, which is why I'm posting here. Maybe I'm just being sensitive? I'm not around teenaged boys and the guys I hang out with would never make comments the way he does. Our family has suggested to his mother (my sister) that she get him therapy, not for these situations but for his anger and other issues he has, but it has been a non-starter.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t mean this to be clickbait or anything although I fully realize how the question sounds, but that really is the question.&lt;/p&gt;

I don&amp;#39;t know what kind he watches. He plays a lot of video games, and although he does have a few friends, he&amp;#39;s generally socially isolated. He is around a lot of women and has been around them most of his life. I would say he has only had 2 significant male family members in his life (father, grandfather).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now to the question: He talks about rape, lightly, quite frequently and at very surprising times. Nothing about a conversation would even be remotely related to a crime let alone rape. I think this only happens around his family; he tends to treat his friends more respectfully than his family members. But if someone mentions a woman or doing something, he&amp;#39;ll say something like &amp;quot;Oh is she gonna get raped&amp;gt;?!&amp;quot; The tone he takes when he&amp;#39;s usually saying it is very light and funny. Or we&amp;#39;ll be watching a show or movie where it is very clear that nothing like sexual assault is going to happen and he&amp;#39;ll say something like &amp;quot;Oh!! He&amp;#39;s gonna rape her!&amp;quot; Or I&amp;#39;ll be talking about going somewhere and he says &amp;quot;What if you get raped,&amp;quot; but not in a &amp;quot;I fear for your safety way.&amp;quot; I can&amp;#39;t describe it. I have never spent a day with him where he hasn&amp;#39;t brought up some out of the blue comment related to rape. And it&amp;#39;s always that word: rape. It&amp;#39;s never &amp;quot;sexual assault&amp;quot; or any other synonym or euphemism for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I and my other sister have asked him multiple times what his obsession is with rape and he never answers. I have made it very clear to him that rape is a crime and have even said that it is very important that you understand that rape is serious and a crime and should not be taken lightly. He never talks about his own interjections. His only mentions of rape are like what I have described above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do about this, which is why I&amp;#39;m posting here. Maybe I&amp;#39;m just being sensitive? I&amp;#39;m not around teenaged boys and the guys I hang out with would never make comments the way he does. Our family has suggested to his mother (my sister) that she get him therapy, not for these situations but for his anger and other issues he has, but it has been a non-starter.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s really important to my partner to keep up his long distance cycling. He’s upset that he doesn’t get to ride as much since having our child 21 months ago. I have been on an extended unpaid leave following my mat leave, with some contract work in facilitating. The facilitation requires being away for a weekend here and there. It’s work that I love and I have a masters degree in the topic and was also accepted to a PhD program for. The facilitation work is part of my career goals. I have returned to my regular full-time work to support the household income, and my partner said I can no longer do weekends away because it interferes with his ability to ride. I made arrangements for our 21 mo to stay with her Nana so that he may still ride. My partner is telling me what I’m doing is child abandonment and that it’s not right for both of us to be away.

I just need some perspectives on this. I see it as a win win for everyone: Dad gets to ride, mom gets to do her dream/career work and child gets to deepen relationship with Nana. Our child is easy going and lovable and Nana adores her. It’s only for one weekend in sept, oct and Nov. 

But my partner is insisting that I can’t do these weekends away because he needs to ride his bike. And he doesn’t want to do the drop off and pick up because it’s about a 50 km commute to and from Nana’s.

I'm here to ask for help

My step son is 6 year's old and can't read yet. He goes to school everyday but it isn't really working. And the problem is that he is in fear and panic whenever we try to teach him to read. And when I say panic I really mean it, he starts crying and screaming and hitting like crazy. Frequently just runs away in panic. And if we insist he will just keep screaming, crying and hitting.

This is not how he normally behaves. But there is something about learning to read that seems to be his worst nightmare. I could record a video to show his panic reaction, is nothing I have ever seen.

Because we live in Zimbabwe is normal for the teachers to use phisical force in the class. Like, hitting him when he missbehaves. So maybe he developted a fear because of that? Although all of his brothers and cousins go to those schools and have no problems

What can we do to get through this? If we just approach a notepad to teach he will start screaming and crying for the whole day. Like he is being absolute tortured.

And even when we don't even force him to stop what he is doing is the same reaction. Like, he is playing his video-game, we will approach with the letters without telling him to stop playing and he will start crying and screaming amd even stop playing to run away to isolation.

Anyway for as long as I can remember my parents have always fought, and even before I remember the fighting I know it happened, I have a faint memory of my 5 year old brother telling 7 year old me he hates my dad. And in that memory I remember they were fighting so it's reasonable to assume it's always been this way.

The situation is, my dad is normally a fun guy who I fairly often have thought provoking discussions on history or politics or whatever.   

But he often gets into these moods, provoked or not where he becomes incredibly hostile, he repeatadly calls home when he's at work pissed off at my mom for whatever reason, and gets more pissed when my mom doesn't want to listen to his rants.


My dad has a good memory and is always willing to bring stuff up that happened 10-15 years ago that he thinks affected him badly or the other person wronged him.
He fights with my mom on average once a week. He is also never appreciative of contradicting opinions.

This often gets worse when he's drunk, he yells, once he got on top of me with his knees on each side of me and hit me a couple times (open palm so legal in my state iirc), but considering the circumstances I kinda had it coming.

He tends to have a short temper, I frequently get called downstairs at 10-12 at night to close kitchen cabinets I left open. 

I'm pretty sure I have anxiety and possibly BPD, and all this doesn't help either of them. I would get diagnosed but it's too expensive.

My mom isn't without fault either, she constantly thinks of extremes or worst case scenarios, gasps and comments on everything in the car needlessly almost causing accidents, and has a tendency to needlessly question and not listen.


Like any kid I quickly learned not to tell them anything that could be used against me, they don't know about relationships and mental health issues I've had etc etc.

My mom has been ""about to divorce"" my dad for as long as I can remember, but nothing has happened so far.

I usually keep it together, I vape and sometimes self harm with a bic lighter which both help, but my state changed the smoking age to 21 so I don't know what I'll do when I run out of my stockpile.

I have basically learned to spend most of my time in my room to avoid conflict, atleast when I'm not working or outside.


I'm currently going through this right now, my dad is calmly calling me to  (but you can hear in his voice he's not calm, it's hard to describe) tell me to tell my mom to pick up the phone.

&lt;p&gt;My dad has a good memory and is always willing to bring stuff up that happened 10-15 years ago that he thinks affected him badly or the other person wronged him.
He fights with my mom on average once a week. He is also never appreciative of contradicting opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This often gets worse when he&amp;#39;s drunk, he yells, once he got on top of me with his knees on each side of me and hit me a couple times (open palm so legal in my state iirc), but considering the circumstances I kinda had it coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tends to have a short temper, I frequently get called downstairs at 10-12 at night to close kitchen cabinets I left open. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I have anxiety and possibly BPD, and all this doesn&amp;#39;t help either of them. I would get diagnosed but it&amp;#39;s too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom isn&amp;#39;t without fault either, she constantly thinks of extremes or worst case scenarios, gasps and comments on everything in the car needlessly almost causing accidents, and has a tendency to needlessly question and not listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any kid I quickly learned not to tell them anything that could be used against me, they don&amp;#39;t know about relationships and mental health issues I&amp;#39;ve had etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom has been &amp;quot;about to divorce&amp;quot; my dad for as long as I can remember, but nothing has happened so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually keep it together, I vape and sometimes self harm with a bic lighter which both help, but my state changed the smoking age to 21 so I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;ll do when I run out of my stockpile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have basically learned to spend most of my time in my room to avoid conflict, atleast when I&amp;#39;m not working or outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently going through this right now, my dad is calmly calling me to  (but you can hear in his voice he&amp;#39;s not calm, it&amp;#39;s hard to describe) tell me to tell my mom to pick up the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah anyway how do I know how bad is bad?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the people I know with 2 kids are fine and if we have one more, it is understood that he/she would be the last. I only work about 30 hours a week and even that seems excessive with her now that she&amp;#39;s older and I wish I could be a SAHM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;#39;d love a second baby just as much but is it worth it?&lt;/p&gt;

TLDR: when will we be able to do what we want again? 

Long version: my wife and I have been fortunate eneough to be able to extensively travel from US to Europe usually once or twice a year. We have established air miles and airline status and travel was always a part of “us”. 

Since the baby was born we have been back to Europe for specific reasons (wedding) however most recently when she was 12 months and traveling was relatively easy at that age. 

Now though it’s hard to keep her entertained for more than 5 mins so long haul travel is basically a no-go throughout the toddler years. Let alone the fact we’d now have to look at buying three tickets, not just two (well, at 2 years we would but no travel is foreseeable until at least far beyond that age). 

So, do we have to wait 10+ years until we travel again (at that age kids are good and can entertain themselves for periods) losing airline status and risk not seeing those important to us who live overseas?

Do I have to resign myself to the fact I have to have shitty stay cations, or expensive Disneyland style / or cruise style vacations which quite frankly look awful and just parenting in expensive locations? 

Do we just plan on zero vacations until she is a teenager?

How and where are we meant to get “travel” back into our life’s?

In a few months I will be taking an out of state trip with two of my friends, lets call them Mary and Jane, and their 2 year old toddler, June. We will be going to a festival where we will be staying off site for a week. Problem is, I have not traveled, stayed near, or been around any toddler since my siblings where wee ones. No babysitting, no cousins, nothing. I don't even want children of my own and I have not even spent much time with June as when I socialize with either of them, Mary and Jane usually switch off watching her and hanging out with me. 

I have very little idea to expect and want to make myself if in no way inconvenient when it comes to June. I know to expect very early mornings and I have been informed of the habit of pulling hair and screaming ""mine"" in your ear as she does it and I plan to ask for allergies in case I bring food back to the room and June somehow gets into it. 

Are there small things that I could keep in my bag that would make my two mom friends life easier (wet wipes, sunscreen, i don't know what kids need, etc.)? June has only seen pictures of me previously and I know I can be intimidating to children (I am 6'3 with fire red hair and like to wear stompy boots) so would it be a good idea to bribe her with a small stuff animal when we arrive or try to meet up with all three of them prior to the trip so I am not a scary giant? I plan to ask about June's routine and assist if I can or just remove myself totally from the situation. 

Is there anything else I could do to make sure that I am a force for good and not evil on this trip?

A couple of things to note-

Thank you!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few months I will be taking an out of state trip with two of my friends, lets call them Mary and Jane, and their 2 year old toddler, June. We will be going to a festival where we will be staying off site for a week. Problem is, I have not traveled, stayed near, or been around any toddler since my siblings where wee ones. No babysitting, no cousins, nothing. I don&amp;#39;t even want children of my own and I have not even spent much time with June as when I socialize with either of them, Mary and Jane usually switch off watching her and hanging out with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have very little idea to expect and want to make myself if in no way inconvenient when it comes to June. I know to expect very early mornings and I have been informed of the habit of pulling hair and screaming &amp;quot;mine&amp;quot; in your ear as she does it and I plan to ask for allergies in case I bring food back to the room and June somehow gets into it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there small things that I could keep in my bag that would make my two mom friends life easier (wet wipes, sunscreen, i don&amp;#39;t know what kids need, etc.)? June has only seen pictures of me previously and I know I can be intimidating to children (I am 6&amp;#39;3 with fire red hair and like to wear stompy boots) so would it be a good idea to bribe her with a small stuff animal when we arrive or try to meet up with all three of them prior to the trip so I am not a scary giant? I plan to ask about June&amp;#39;s routine and assist if I can or just remove myself totally from the situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything else I could do to make sure that I am a force for good and not evil on this trip?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of things to note-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will be traveling and arriving separately, as it was most convenient option, but will be sharing a hotel suite when we arrive, with separate rooms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary has been doing most of the planning for this trip and I did attempt to ask these questions, but she mostly told me not to worry about it. I don&amp;#39;t know enough about it to know what I am not supposed to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I plan to split off from them for about 5-6 hours each day in order to allow them to join the festival as a family and so I may drink in peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I'm just stuck wondering if I can get some advice. Like my title says I am disabled. It's impossible to enumerate every way this causes issues in my life, but there are a few that relate to parenting that cause me the most concern.

1) the inability to squat lift (stand up squat down grab something with both hands and return to a standing position) with anything more than a few pounds.

2) The inability to safely carry a kid and walk. If I lose my balance, which does happen. I essentially drop everything and plank down. It's great for not breaking my face but obviously not safe for a.kid.

Now none of these cause me great concern during the newborn phase. It will be difficult, but they are basically cute/frustrating inanimate objects. If I need to strap a newborn into a stroller and go somewhere it's not like the newborn will be able to do much about it.

However, I'm more concerned about ages 1-5. Everytime I see my nieces/nephews who are currently that age I seem to automatically keep a count of how many times kiddo gets picked up. The most common example recently was a 2 year old who missed his nap and was teething. Every 30 mins or so he would start crying/get wound up for a tantrum. Like clockwork mom/dad would grab him walk to another room calm him down and bring him back. Can't do that.

Or the time they get somewhere and the steps are just too big for them and mom/dad carry them up 2 stairs to get inside the house. Can't do that.

Haven't seen this one but can totally imagine it.

I'm imagining a full on collapse on floor tantrum here over something dumb (like let's say getting dressed for the day) where the normal solution under time crunch is to get kiddo off floor and start dressing him while he recovers from tantrum and then carry him out the door into car and roll out. Once again can't do that.

Now people here might say 'mom can handle that', but...what if mom isn't around? Shit happens ya know?

Let's just say I'm in my twenties and no beautiful angels have popped out yet. I've been thinking lately I want a child, but I have no idea if or when I will be ready. I have PTSD, anxiety, and more. So I'm scared that if I do take that step that something might happen. By that I mean what if I'm not a good parent because of the various things going on with me? 

After the life I have had I would absolutely go crazy if anybody hurt my child in any way. I had the craziest thought that I found intriguing and wanted to share it, and maybe even get some opinions. I was thinking about how much heartache I've experienced, how some days I couldn't even find the will to continue on, or some days I sat in tears as my past came back to haunt me.

A thought popped in my head. I was just like what if having a child would heal me? Like in a way it would make me face the things that hurt me, but also make me put them to the side. This isn't the only reason I want a child, but does becoming a mother in particular change you? This applies to fathers as well. Like how has having a child changed your life? Have there been any instances where you changed your life around for your child? Any cases where you may have been at your worst and maybe that small living being gave you hope?

I'm extremely curious. Did it make you more mature? Did you grow up faster? Like I have always wondered what a mothers love was like. I can't imagine the feeling because I'm not a mother and I can't imagine it from a fathers perspective either. I remember asking my mom a long time ago if it felt like being in love, and she said yes but deeper and different. So is it a different kind of love? A totally new feeling? Like this is probably the wrong thing to say, but I think if it came down to it my mom would give up her life for mine. 

So is loving your child really that deep? Please keep in mind this is all mostly curiosity. I don't know what it's like to be a mother. So I'm kind of scared of the unknown. My current boyfriend is ready to have kids, but I'm afraid of myself. I don't want to damage one of the most precious and purest things I can bring into this world. I've seen what abuse looks like I WOULD NEVER do that. 

I just wouldn't want them to see me at my worst. Me crying, me having nightmares, me in my moods. It all scares me. I guess if I'm being honest I'm sacred to have a child because I feel like I won't be able to protect them from all of the things that nearly destroyed me and my entire life. I'm so scared that the one second they are out of my sight I might fail them. That something might happen.

By that I mean what if I&amp;#39;m not a good parent because of the various things going on with me? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the life I have had I would absolutely go crazy if anybody hurt my child in any way. I had the craziest thought that I found intriguing and wanted to share it, and maybe even get some opinions. I was thinking about how much heartache I&amp;#39;ve experienced, how some days I couldn&amp;#39;t even find the will to continue on, or some days I sat in tears as my past came back to haunt me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thought popped in my head. I was just like what if having a child would heal me? Like in a way it would make me face the things that hurt me, but also make me put them to the side. This isn&amp;#39;t the only reason I want a child, but does becoming a mother in particular change you? This applies to fathers as well. Like how has having a child changed your life? Have there been any instances where you changed your life around for your child? Any cases where you may have been at your worst and maybe that small living being gave you hope?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m extremely curious. Did it make you more mature? Did you grow up faster? Like I have always wondered what a mothers love was like. I can&amp;#39;t imagine the feeling because I&amp;#39;m not a mother and I can&amp;#39;t imagine it from a fathers perspective either. I remember asking my mom a long time ago if it felt like being in love, and she said yes but deeper and different. So is it a different kind of love? A totally new feeling? Like this is probably the wrong thing to say, but I think if it came down to it my mom would give up her life for mine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is loving your child really that deep? Please keep in mind this is all mostly curiosity. I don&amp;#39;t know what it&amp;#39;s like to be a mother. So I&amp;#39;m kind of scared of the unknown. My current boyfriend is ready to have kids, but I&amp;#39;m afraid of myself. I don&amp;#39;t want to damage one of the most precious and purest things I can bring into this world. I&amp;#39;ve seen what abuse looks like I WOULD NEVER do that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wouldn&amp;#39;t want them to see me at my worst. Me crying, me having nightmares, me in my moods. It all scares me. I guess if I&amp;#39;m being honest I&amp;#39;m sacred to have a child because I feel like I won&amp;#39;t be able to protect them from all of the things that nearly destroyed me and my entire life. I&amp;#39;m so scared that the one second they are out of my sight I might fail them. That something might happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do hope that this does not offend anyone, or that this is not too stupid to even ask.&lt;/p&gt;

My younger sister is in her third year of high school now. She had a really rough time as a sophomore - she failed her calculus course which she took at a college near us (the high school she goes to has a joint program with a nearby college) &amp; also had a really hard time in her AP classes.

This was really surprising to me, because I know she is smart. She hide her failing calculus from my parents and when they found out, they took her phone away. There was a huge fight, which resulted in my sister telling them they put too much pressure on her and that she had tried to kill herself twice before. I have already moved out, and live on the other side of the country now, so I wasn't there when this all happened. This was a big red flag for me, and I told my parents they need to take her to therapy or get her some help. My mother did take her and they have been working through these problems.

Now, things had seemingly calmed down. But, my mother one day decided to look through my sister's phone. She saw messages from a boy that goes to her high school and logs of phone calls specifically made during school hours when she should have been in class. The text messages scared my mom as she saw the boy was trying to pressure her into sex and other things which had been going on through out the past year. My mother is convinced this is one of the reasons my sister didn't do well in school this past year and that she has become distracted. I want to stress that my sister has always been really focused on doing well on school.

My parents talked to my sister and it just did not go well. She is convinced she loves this boy and she told them she would continue to see him regardless of what they said. My parents are at a loss on what to do. There is clearly a lot going on, and my mom believes this boy is bad news and will have a negative affect on my sister's grades. 

Any advice on how to handle this? I have no idea and neither do my parents. I had always listened to my parents when I was in high school, my rebellious stage hit when I was in college.

My sister is not the same person she used to be and I know it hurts my parents to watch her fail and start going down the wrong path.

My parents are thinking about pulling her out from her school and switching to another one. My mom also wants to talk to the boy's parents.

How Do I Deal With Mom Guilt? To me it&amp;#39;s almost crippling and I don&amp;#39;t want my anxiety to wear off onto my son. He is 9 months old and since the day I had him I am constantly worrying about everything. I know that it &amp;quot;shows that I care&amp;quot; or whatnot but sometimes I feel like I need a therapist because of how bad it gets. No matter how much time I spend with him, how much I love him etc. I constantly feel like I&amp;#39;m failing or not giving my best.. I&amp;#39;ve also heard &amp;quot;an over protected kid cannot live to its full potential&amp;quot; and this is what I fear the most, I don&amp;#39;t want him to be under developed or riddled with anxiety because of me.. I just don&amp;#39;t want to ruin him... Any advise???&lt;/p&gt;

Anyways, the first 4 time I thought this is stupid and pointless. After 5, I said I'll keep trying it, after 10 I couldn't stop. I look like I'm 18 bit NJ legal age is 21 for tobacco and Vapes and I was vaping down busy streets and didn't give a damn because I didn't see a cop. What happened was I posted it on Snapchat, my aunt who I thought doesn't even use Snapchat anymore saw my story. Plus I almost forgot to hide it tonight and i keep stuff in my pockets by accident a lot. Anyways, probably soon it's gonna end up in our washer and yeah what do you I'll get as punishment?

Anyways I&amp;#39;m already addicted and don&amp;#39;t know what to do. Honestly I have to blame my self and social media. I saw so many of my friends vaping on social media, so that kinda encouraged me to. Anyways, the first 4 time I thought this is stupid and pointless. After 5, I said I&amp;#39;ll keep trying it, after 10 I couldn&amp;#39;t stop. I look like I&amp;#39;m 18 bit NJ legal age is 21 for tobacco and Vapes and I was vaping down busy streets and didn&amp;#39;t give a damn because I didn&amp;#39;t see a cop. What happened was I posted it on Snapchat, my aunt who I thought doesn&amp;#39;t even use Snapchat anymore saw my story. Plus I almost forgot to hide it tonight and i keep stuff in my pockets by accident a lot. Anyways, probably soon it&amp;#39;s gonna end up in our washer and yeah what do you I&amp;#39;ll get as punishment?

I and my husband are planning to have a baby in about a year. Currently we both are working and have comfortable income and saving. 

Though I like my current job my commute to work is long and I have a hectic job.  I am learning a lot. I would be leverage experience in to a better role (more paying) in a year or so probably.  

The legal maternity leave in my country is 6 months. But most likely my employer won't be able to absorb that as I work in a small company. And most likely legal recourse will take too much time.

I have a option to take up a lower paying job (like -20%) nearer to home and better timings. But I am not sure if it's a job profile I would enjoy. But it would limit opportunity to grow.

I have been in online forums for new mothers for research purposes. And found that many find it's difficult to back to work at least find it difficult to go back to hectic schedule.
I have also found that a child's primary caretaker has a huge influence in their overall IQ and EQ when they grow up.
 

The Dilemma.

I think I want to take care of my baby and not be dependent on others like nanny etc. Especially when they are very young. 
I also love the work I do and thankfully I get paid well.I don't know how I will be able to go back to work  or a similar job after a break.

Should I take up the lower paying job?

The other day, my SIL group texts the family saying they found out 3 of the gerbils have some gastric illness that is contagious to humans and they will be bringing them to the vet to be put down, leaving my neice with only 2 of the baby gerbils.

Three out of four of these kids behave themselves just fine, we don't bother anyone and our quarrels are quiet and often forgettable. One of these kids, however, is one of the hardest ones you'll ever meet. He sits in front of a television all day watching YouTube and playing video games. The only time he gets up is when he goes to the store to buy junk food or throw a fit (which we'll get to in a moment). Over the years I've seen him getting progressively fatter and angrier; I get a little sadder every time I see him sitting there, gorging on unhealthy snacks, hypnotized by the screen all day. I would like advice on how to inspire him to take up some healthy habits, but that isn't the primary reason I'm posting this.

This family has a very pressing matter on it's hands: finding a place to live. It's hard enough to find a place when we have barely enough money to get by and satisfy the beast of a child with anything he wants. And despite our bad credit (from past mistakes my parents made when I was a small kid), we might be able to find a reasonable place to live... except for one thing: Him.

As I type this, I can look to my left and see three patches of unpainted drywall that mark where he kicked holes in the wall. There are holes in numerous places in the apartment hidden behind awkwardly placed picture frames and furniture, but we can't hide all that he does. There are six doors in our house, and half of them are broken in some way or another; the blinds on **every** window as well. I can walk into the kitchen and see a red stain of juice on the ceiling. I don't think there's a single room in this apartment that hasn't been tainted by his wrath.

What usually initiates his wrath is his food addictions. Our cabinets could be exploding with food of all kinds, but if it isn't the stuff he likes, he goes bonkers. You can probably guess what kind of food it is: ice cream, soda, chips, etc. stuff my mom didn't dare buy until a couple years ago (she really believes in healthy, natural food). He'll usually start by pausing his game or video and saying, ""Mom, I'm hungry,"" not quite screaming yet. That's when our mother says, ""We don't have enough money to keep buying all the junk food you want! We have plenty of food. Want me to cook you something?"" And he loses it. He'll start out soft, throwing around little papers and whining quietly, then he'll start knocking chairs over and raising his voice, then before you know it he's screaming and kicking one of the heaters (which are all broken, by the way) and my mom gives in once he's done enough. This is just one example of what starts his fits of rage. Often times, *I'm* his problem. Most of the other kids have a fear of him, despite him being the youngest. I'm not scared of him, just angry usually. I think he fears me because I'm the only other authority in this house besides his mother. He'll see me walking along, minding my business, and he'll shout at me, ""What do you want?!"" to which I'll reply, ""Just doing \[something\],"" and he'll scream to his mother that I'm bothering him. She'll usually start screaming at me that if I bother him, he'll break something and cause noise (which is absurdly counter intuitive) and we'll be out of an apartment. I want to clobber the shit out of him, but I know that won't do anything, plus he'd throw a fit and my mother would be furious.

On a side note, it's hard to focus on things I want to do (mostly reading, writing, and piano) when there's a constant screaming fight right outside my room 24/7. I don't want to have to leave the house just to get something done.

My daughter is extremely loving, she loves physical contact but lately she's been especially demanding of it. So much so that I am beginning to get frustrated with her wanting to be under me all the time. I feel guilty for feeling this way because I know shes very affectionate and I'm just not used to it and she doesnt understand that mommy gets overwhelmed with too much physical contact. Its been emotionally and mentally draining lately, because I'm beginning to feel like I'll hold her, not because I care to help her feel better, but just to get her to stop whinning. I dont want to feel this way because I have this fear that she will sense that and become disconnected from me. And I want her to feel safe and secure with me, always. I don't have that security to go to my mother about things because she wasnt an very affectionate mother.. She worked 12+ hr shifts growing up so we were always under my grandma's care. And I made a promise to my daughter to do anything to make her feel safe with me. 

But unfortunately, I am feeling touched out. I just want to be away from her so that I can collect my self. Because some days I feel like I cant focus or get a grip on things because all I hear is whinning and crying. I feel like I'm loosing myself trying to meet her emotional needs and I know I cant be the best me without taking care of my mental health. But honestly, its been so hard to focus on getting better because she is so demanding of my attention. And its difficult because I dont want to be emotionally negligent to her, but I'm at the point where I dont have the energy to emotionally engage in her. I feel like frustration is my initial reaction, and I've yelled at her and denied her being held because its become so much. Even now it still eats me up because I know she doesnt understand, and I apologize to her.

I feel guilty for feeling this way because I know shes very affectionate and I&amp;#39;m just not used to it and she doesnt understand that mommy gets overwhelmed with too much physical contact. Its been emotionally and mentally draining lately, because I&amp;#39;m beginning to feel like I&amp;#39;ll hold her, not because I care to help her feel better, but just to get her to stop whinning. I dont want to feel this way because I have this fear that she will sense that and become disconnected from me. And I want her to feel safe and secure with me, always. I don&amp;#39;t have that security to go to my mother about things because she wasnt an very affectionate mother.. She worked 12+ hr shifts growing up so we were always under my grandma&amp;#39;s care. And I made a promise to my daughter to do anything to make her feel safe with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But unfortunately, I am feeling touched out. I just want to be away from her so that I can collect my self. Because some days I feel like I cant focus or get a grip on things because all I hear is whinning and crying. I feel like I&amp;#39;m loosing myself trying to meet her emotional needs and I know I cant be the best me without taking care of my mental health. But honestly, its been so hard to focus on getting better because she is so demanding of my attention. And its difficult because I dont want to be emotionally negligent to her, but I&amp;#39;m at the point where I dont have the energy to emotionally engage in her. I feel like frustration is my initial reaction, and I&amp;#39;ve yelled at her and denied her being held because its become so much. Even now it still eats me up because I know she doesnt understand, and I apologize to her. However, I can&amp;#39;t shake the feeling I&amp;#39;m doing more harm than good so if you guys can help with some advice or how you&amp;#39;ve personally dealt with it, it&amp;#39;d help a lot. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

Lengthy story ahead

I'm asking this question here as I wasn't sure where to go. I thought I'd ask other parents this question so they can give me the perspective of this scenario from a parent. How should a daughter go about doing something like this?

Anyways, I love my mom, she is amazing and spectacular in so many ways and I wouldn't be the person I am today if not for her. However, after her heart attack last December which required immediate surgery and a stent, she's been difficult. I'm making this post because I would really appreciate some advice on how I can approach my mom to take her health and her life seriously.

A bit about my mom before her heart attack: She's in her late 50s. She's smoked for as long as I can remember (probably since her late teens or early 20s). She used to smoke A LOT. Possibly 1 park every 1-2 days. We've tried to make her quit in the past (I've been trying all my life) but it just wasn't happening. She also used to drink a ton of coffee. She has healthy habits like her love for vegetables, gardening, and walking, but she also has her vices. My mom is very compulsive and easily addicted to things and activities like gambling (cards games with friends) as well. She is also difficult to talk to as she is prideful and has no problem lying for the sake of her pride.

Before her heart attack she was relatively fine, atleast she felt like she was. She was also keeping her vices in control. When the heart attack happened in December, it was scary... All that matters though was that she was taken to operating just in time. I only found out about everything after she had the operation. When I saw her she looked tired, but fine. She was asking when she could go home because she had to go to work. She felt like this thing would just be a quick hospital trip, like she didn't understand the seriousness of what just happened to her. 

She does her stay at the hospital. My sisters and I visit her every day. We make sure we're listening to the doctor and that she's listening as well. She understands that she'll need to be taking maintenance medicine from now on. She can't smoke anymore, she can't drink nearly that much caffiene anymore. Essentially a lot of to change. She can't garden, work, or walk all that much for a while. It's almost like her life is at a standstill. One thing she did get a kick out of was that while she's recovering, she can entertain herself with activities that aren't too physically straining, like playing cards...

Fast-forward today. My mom plays cards much too often. So often that she's had a falling out with one of my sisters over it. She spends money a bit too carelessly despite not working as often anymore. She sometimes forgets to take her medicine. She is definitely smoking again. She is drinking coffee again. She's not necessarily keeping track of what she eats. She's gained significant weight. She is not healthy... And now she's planning on travelling back to the homeland when my sisters and I know for a fact that the doctor said it would be around 10 months before she could travel, and she would need travel clearance from her doctor, which we don't think she has. It's almost as if she's lost her boundaries after the heart attack. 

When we have tried to talk to her about our concerns she outright lies to us or she is offended and feels as though we don't respect her. We catch her smoking she says it was just this once. I find lighters in her belongings she says it's not hers, ""I don't smoke anymore remember?"" 

I don't know how to approach my mom in this. I don't know how to compel her to take these things seriously. If something were to happen to her while travelling, she will die. There's no way she'll get the medical attention she needs. There's no way to get her into a hospital in time if anything happens. We're so worried because my family and I wont be there to monitor her behaviour and keep her in check. I am worried, and scared, and upset, and angry.

People suggest that I go with her when she travels. But it doesn't change the fact that her current health is not good. It doesn't change the fact that she runs the risk of having another heart attack during this trip. 

When I imagine talking to her about my concerns such as the smoking, the gambling, the meds, the doctor's travel clearance. I can just imagine her shutting down the conversation. She'll say everything is taken cared of. She'll say she has the doctor clearance. She'll say she doesn't know what I'm talking about. She'll say that the lighters I've taken from her purse aren't hers ( I've taken 3 in the past 2 months). She'll say I don't respect her. She'll shut down the conversation. She'll be mad at me. 

I just don't know where to even begin...

How can I talk to her without making her feel attacked? How can I have a serious conversation with her if she lies? What can I do ...?

Any and all advice would be very much appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warning. Lengthy story ahead&lt;/p&gt;

I love this kid, even though he's a shit sometimes but I'm pretty sure most kids are at one time or another. 

Recently since we moved into our new house with his own room and bed, I've been monitoring his diet. Instead of hot dogs and popsicles and marshmallows, I've been giving him grapes and apples and grilled chicken. I don't make a fuss when he goes to his grandma's and she feeds him junk; she's his grandma and that's her right. 

However, she doesn't seem to have the same respect for my decisions. She's been sending back bags of marshmallows, hotdogs and chicken nuggets. She tells my husband that if I throw them away, then we're ungrateful for all the things she does for us.

 The other day I sent her a text message with a detailed account of what he ate that day before dropping him off at 11am; ""apples with vanilla yogurt, a small bowl of cereal and a little bit of ice cream with grandmas marshmallows :)"".

She took it as a side jab. She complained to my husband about how I judge her for the way she feeds him. I'm starting to feel like I can't win with this woman.

To make matters worse, she was over the other day with Chinese and said some pretty upsetting things to my stepson. He hadn't napped very well that day and he was cranky, so when she asked him for a hug and he ignored her, she threatened that he would never be allowed over at grandma's house again. 

He started balling his eyes out, but he still wouldn't hug her, so she left him crying on the floor, screaming for grandma. She left out the front door and let him scream for her through the living room window. Needless to say, I was pretty pissed and so was my husband. We both thought it was manipulative and cruel. He's four! I don't know what to do with this woman. She's stressing me out! If it were my KID I don't think I could say nothing. Help 😭

TL:DR; I've been involved with my step son for two years and my mother-in-law doesn't respect the decisions his father and I make while he's with us. She undermines our best intentions for him by sending junk food to the house when we decided to feed him a healthier diet, and she made him cry by threatening to never have him at her house again because he wouldn't hug her.

&lt;p&gt;However, she doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have the same respect for my decisions. She&amp;#39;s been sending back bags of marshmallows, hotdogs and chicken nuggets. She tells my husband that if I throw them away, then we&amp;#39;re ungrateful for all the things she does for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I sent her a text message with a detailed account of what he ate that day before dropping him off at 11am; &amp;quot;apples with vanilla yogurt, a small bowl of cereal and a little bit of ice cream with grandmas marshmallows :)&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She took it as a side jab. She complained to my husband about how I judge her for the way she feeds him. I&amp;#39;m starting to feel like I can&amp;#39;t win with this woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, she was over the other day with Chinese and said some pretty upsetting things to my stepson. He hadn&amp;#39;t napped very well that day and he was cranky, so when she asked him for a hug and he ignored her, she threatened that he would never be allowed over at grandma&amp;#39;s house again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He started balling his eyes out, but he still wouldn&amp;#39;t hug her, so she left him crying on the floor, screaming for grandma. She left out the front door and let him scream for her through the living room window. Needless to say, I was pretty pissed and so was my husband. We both thought it was manipulative and cruel. He&amp;#39;s four! I don&amp;#39;t know what to do with this woman. She&amp;#39;s stressing me out! If it were my KID I don&amp;#39;t think I could say nothing. Help 😭&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL:DR; I&amp;#39;ve been involved with my step son for two years and my mother-in-law doesn&amp;#39;t respect the decisions his father and I make while he&amp;#39;s with us. She undermines our best intentions for him by sending junk food to the house when we decided to feed him a healthier diet, and she made him cry by threatening to never have him at her house again because he wouldn&amp;#39;t hug her. Help!&lt;/p&gt;

TW: suicide mentions and alcohol

I tried to kill myself in December 9 months ago and am since doing so much better due to my moms love and support. I was dead for a couple seconds, but this isn't what I'm here to ask about.

Last night I went to my friends house, L, and she told me to come over. Some backstory: I used to get high with A everyday because I was in a state of severe (diagnosed and genetic) depression for two years that nobody would let me get treated for because they didn't believe me. My parents have since apologized. I know she's trouble and have always known. L is super nice, I knew they were friends, and L has only seen me and A hug like one time and thought we were either old friends or practically strangers I suppose.

We went to the gas station for a bit then were outside for an hour. it was super hot but L wanted to meet this guy that has a crush on her and vice versa. I say okay whatever, I go and get a huge liter of Dr pepper because they asked me too. I come back and she says she met up with him and I asked why it ended so quickly and she said oh I just wanted something so im like alright.

This is gonna sound like complete and utter bullshit, but heres some things to keep in mind: I am very book smart. Academically, I excell. Socially, I just kind of do what everybody says because I secretly have really bad anxiety and don't wanna stand out too much.

I went to the bathroom to wipe myself down because I was sweating so so bad but I didn't wanna let it be known because that's awkward (side note: A knows I refuse to smoke anymore and have abstained from everything for a long time). 

I was gone for five-ten minutes to calm myself down, prep talk, all the classic ""youve got this!"" in the mirror and also trying to hide my sweat because jesus christ her room didnt have ac and A hogged up the fan. I come back and they poured the Dr pepper into this huge slushy container and told me they made a special drink. I asked them what it was obviously because I dont wanna betray my mom again and also itd be dumb for me to complain about getting handed a ""special drink"" that ended up being alcohol.

Keep in mind, this container was huge. I mean, huge. They said it's this really good tasting concoction of this lime margirita mix in the corner and Dr pepper and a little beer for taste (?) and said that's why it tastes kinda weird. With liqour, it hits HARD. it burns your throat. I guess not when its 3 shots in a liter of Dr pepper and margarita mix.

And me being me I didn't wanna say it wasn't that good but if I ignored it it was fine because I was still so hot and wanted to cool down so I put a lot of ice in it and came back. I ended up drinking the whole thing in a matter of an hour.

I don't really know my alcohol so I don't know if an 100 lb teenage girl can get drunk off 3 shots, but that's what happened to me.

They told me I should've loosened myself up and that they were all just trying to have fun (I refuse to look smell or touch weed because it brings back bad memories and couldn't control myself when they kept offering. Also, I live in a state where weed is illegal, so I don't know why they offer it so much. Go have fun with yourselves! Im okay being the babysitter!)

They saw that I was visibly drunk because I kept admitting my feelings to my crush (idk what ill do about that now but its the least of my problems) and told me to take another shot (maybe i took two? i don't even know anymore) from the bottle My biggest mistake next to not getting out of there when I saw A is taking another one. I understand I was visibly intoxicated but I still could've been smart.

Now my mother is broken again, because Ls brother had to drop me off at home. The whole night I was crying screaming for my mom because I was scared and broken and they kept making me go to the park even though I didn't want to. I lost an hour of time I have no clue what happened for an hour. I guess they were tired of me being a buzzkill and falling on my ass and bruising myself 20 times with a scraped knee and ten cuts everywhere (when I woke up today I disinfected everything and put different size bandages on).

I come home crying, my mom thinks I got raped, they're all screaming at me and telling me I'm a selfish dumbass bitch for doing this to them again (referring to my attempt) and I can't comprehend it because I was just really happy to be home again I thought they were happy I was safe. How do I make this up to them? Should I just say I made a dumb mistake and knew that I was taking shots? I feel like they wouldnt believe me even though they know how A is which I understand.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello! Im 15 and live in the US.&lt;br/&gt;

I'm using an alternate account just in case and because I just don't know what to do anymore. Almost 3 years ago, I took in my youngest sister. In the interest of not making this the longest reddit post in history, I'll try to sum it up by saying she chose to move out of our mother's house at the age of 17 because our mother was an abusive narcissist with BPD and bipolar (diagnosed, not medicated due to her own choice). She came to live with my SO and me. TL;DR at bottom because this still got way longer than I thought it would.

Being homeschooled (using an online program), she was supposed to have been a senior at that time. However, due to a combination of her learned behaviors from living in a terrible environment and my mother's financial irresponsibility, she was not done with her courses, nor was she even close. She was still considered a sophomore at the time. After a lot of work and money to pay for most of these classes that she was retaking, (because they were never paid off the first time but the time limit had expired so she had to start them over again) she is now finishing up and preparing to go off to college 3 hours away in a few weeks. All seems fine and dandy right? Wrong. 

While we have worked hard to get her back on track (she's graduating with honors, got into her first choice college, fully funded, saved up for her own car, has a job, a really nice boyfriend, etc.) we are still greatly struggling with some other things and it seems like they just keep adding up. For starters, she lies about even trivial things. We've tried several ways to combat this behavior. I realize that it comes from her trauma (I came from that same household, but as the oldest and least favorite, so believe me when I say I've been through the ringer) because I had/have some issues myself. I've been in therapy for years. Since then I've improved to the point that I'm really only battling anxiety at this point which I know doesn't go away easily, but continued therapy and medication is helping tremendously. But with my sister who is now 19, it seems she just doesn't get it. I've asked my therapist for help on this as well and she's given me some great tools to use, some of which have worked, others that have not. Another issue is helping around the house. I've asked, and asked, and asked, gone to telling, demanding, nagging, back to asking before something gets done. She does absolutely nothing to help. Her bedroom is a pig sty. She will clean it occasionally on her own and then it gets bad again, which I've brushed off as typical teen behavior. But getting help with ANYTHING else is like pulling teeth. I recently had a serious surgical procedure that limits what I can and cannot do. One thing I cannot do is dishes (also heavy lifting, typical post-op stuff you're not supposed to do when you've had upper extremities operated on) and I made it clear before I had the procedure that I would need her and SO to step up and help out more as I recover. I did the dishes the night before my procedure (which was 8 days ago) and even made a list of what foods we had in the house, what meals we had that were either easy to make or ready to warm up, how much the dog gets for her food and when, because I do all of this myself. In the last 8 days, she has cooked twice. Cleaned up after dinner once. And not a soul has touched the dishes in 8 days so they are piled up in the kitchen. SO has been working non stop (14+ hour days), had to take her to her college orientation, and still asks me every day how I'm feeling and what do I need, etc. She doesn't ask and just gets mad if she can't go somewhere. Her car's fuel pump went and is in the shop...so she always wants to borrow my car. 

My sister and a friend who is also attending the same school decided to get an apartment together for their first year. Fine, I know her friend and have known this girl since she was a tiny little munchkin, they got a good deal and it's close to campus and safe. However, I keep getting things in the mail for dorm supplies from the school. It's been just ads so I brushed it off as they send that to all first years parents. But then last night I see in the mail that she's received something about welcome weekend, room assignments and roommates. Why would she be receiving this if she's not living on campus? This morning, as well, I see in my email (I have USPS informed delivery) that she's receiving something from the town court the next town over. I'm assuming she got a ticket. She hasn't said anything about this to me or SO. We have been her parents for 3 years. I realize she's 19 now, but mentally she is not. 

Every time I confront her about lying about something she gets defensive. Then she will hide upstairs for the rest of the day and act like I kicked her dog. I'm at the end of my rope here and don't know what to do. I've avoided her this morning because when the mail comes I need to confront her about the court letter and her housing letter. I've already decided that she will be living on campus if she didn't ever inform them she would not be. She's probably locked in at this point. 

Side note; I know she needs therapy. It's obvious. However, she's an adult legally, and I can't force her to go. I've tried setting it up for her and she just doesn't go. I've had other people help me out by talking to her about it and offering to help her out with it, set it up for her, etc. and she still doesn't. But then complains that she's messed up and knows it and can't handle things. 

TL;DR: Took little sister in, has issues from past with abusive mother, some not resolving including incessant lying. Now may have failed to fix her school housing arrangements, got a letter in the mail from a court as well as mail indicating that she's not taken care of the housing for school appropriately. Has not been helping out with household work at all, even though I've had a surgical procedure and need the help. Acts defensive and distant when confronted about lying. At my wit's end with what to do as I've tried so many different things including help of my therapist.

ANY advice is welcome at this point. I can't take it anymore.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello parents,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m using an alternate account just in case and because I just don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore. Almost 3 years ago, I took in my youngest sister. In the interest of not making this the longest reddit post in history, I&amp;#39;ll try to sum it up by saying she chose to move out of our mother&amp;#39;s house at the age of 17 because our mother was an abusive narcissist with BPD and bipolar (diagnosed, not medicated due to her own choice). She came to live with my SO and me. TL;DR at bottom because this still got way longer than I thought it would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being homeschooled (using an online program), she was supposed to have been a senior at that time. However, due to a combination of her learned behaviors from living in a terrible environment and my mother&amp;#39;s financial irresponsibility, she was not done with her courses, nor was she even close. She was still considered a sophomore at the time. After a lot of work and money to pay for most of these classes that she was retaking, (because they were never paid off the first time but the time limit had expired so she had to start them over again) she is now finishing up and preparing to go off to college 3 hours away in a few weeks. All seems fine and dandy right? Wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we have worked hard to get her back on track (she&amp;#39;s graduating with honors, got into her first choice college, fully funded, saved up for her own car, has a job, a really nice boyfriend, etc.) we are still greatly struggling with some other things and it seems like they just keep adding up. For starters, she lies about even trivial things. We&amp;#39;ve tried several ways to combat this behavior. I realize that it comes from her trauma (I came from that same household, but as the oldest and least favorite, so believe me when I say I&amp;#39;ve been through the ringer) because I had/have some issues myself. I&amp;#39;ve been in therapy for years. Since then I&amp;#39;ve improved to the point that I&amp;#39;m really only battling anxiety at this point which I know doesn&amp;#39;t go away easily, but continued therapy and medication is helping tremendously. But with my sister who is now 19, it seems she just doesn&amp;#39;t get it. I&amp;#39;ve asked my therapist for help on this as well and she&amp;#39;s given me some great tools to use, some of which have worked, others that have not. Another issue is helping around the house. I&amp;#39;ve asked, and asked, and asked, gone to telling, demanding, nagging, back to asking before something gets done. She does absolutely nothing to help. Her bedroom is a pig sty. She will clean it occasionally on her own and then it gets bad again, which I&amp;#39;ve brushed off as typical teen behavior. But getting help with ANYTHING else is like pulling teeth. I recently had a serious surgical procedure that limits what I can and cannot do. One thing I cannot do is dishes (also heavy lifting, typical post-op stuff you&amp;#39;re not supposed to do when you&amp;#39;ve had upper extremities operated on) and I made it clear before I had the procedure that I would need her and SO to step up and help out more as I recover. I did the dishes the night before my procedure (which was 8 days ago) and even made a list of what foods we had in the house, what meals we had that were either easy to make or ready to warm up, how much the dog gets for her food and when, because I do all of this myself. In the last 8 days, she has cooked twice. Cleaned up after dinner once. And not a soul has touched the dishes in 8 days so they are piled up in the kitchen. SO has been working non stop (14+ hour days), had to take her to her college orientation, and still asks me every day how I&amp;#39;m feeling and what do I need, etc. She doesn&amp;#39;t ask and just gets mad if she can&amp;#39;t go somewhere. Her car&amp;#39;s fuel pump went and is in the shop...so she always wants to borrow my car. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sister and a friend who is also attending the same school decided to get an apartment together for their first year. Fine, I know her friend and have known this girl since she was a tiny little munchkin, they got a good deal and it&amp;#39;s close to campus and safe. However, I keep getting things in the mail for dorm supplies from the school. It&amp;#39;s been just ads so I brushed it off as they send that to all first years parents. But then last night I see in the mail that she&amp;#39;s received something about welcome weekend, room assignments and roommates. Why would she be receiving this if she&amp;#39;s not living on campus? This morning, as well, I see in my email (I have USPS informed delivery) that she&amp;#39;s receiving something from the town court the next town over. I&amp;#39;m assuming she got a ticket. She hasn&amp;#39;t said anything about this to me or SO. We have been her parents for 3 years. I realize she&amp;#39;s 19 now, but mentally she is not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time I confront her about lying about something she gets defensive. Then she will hide upstairs for the rest of the day and act like I kicked her dog. I&amp;#39;m at the end of my rope here and don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I&amp;#39;ve avoided her this morning because when the mail comes I need to confront her about the court letter and her housing letter. I&amp;#39;ve already decided that she will be living on campus if she didn&amp;#39;t ever inform them she would not be. She&amp;#39;s probably locked in at this point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note; I know she needs therapy. It&amp;#39;s obvious. However, she&amp;#39;s an adult legally, and I can&amp;#39;t force her to go. I&amp;#39;ve tried setting it up for her and she just doesn&amp;#39;t go. I&amp;#39;ve had other people help me out by talking to her about it and offering to help her out with it, set it up for her, etc. and she still doesn&amp;#39;t. But then complains that she&amp;#39;s messed up and knows it and can&amp;#39;t handle things. &lt;/p&gt;

Not ultra relevant info to begin with, but I'd like to give some context.

I'm 33, married but no kids yet.

My sister's 35, married to a 49 years old; 3 kids. (13, 8, 6). Her eldest is from another father (previous relationship).

Her eldest is also my godchild. He is turning 14 next week. As a present, he's coming over from Friday afternoon to Sunday afternoon. We'll play some board games on Friday, go to a theme park on Saturday and an Arcade/VR on Sunday. Everything he loves (and so do I, apart from the theme park). Also good to know, he's hyperactive.

The kid is kind, funny but craves attention and has issues at school (bad influences, hyperactivity -&gt; attention) but also he doesn't seem to care. His biggest issue is with authority, I believe. He also lies frequently and has stolen money in the past.

My sister knows only two settings ""nothing"" and yelling ""go to your room"". She's a bit of a Karen/Soccer mom. And I'm not sure she ever had a real **talk** with him.

Don't get me wrong, she's my sister and I love her as such. I don't agree with some of her choices but I'm not in any position to judge or point at her parenting skills, even though some seem to be common sense. (Plus: she's stubborn, if I tell her anything about the way she raises her kids, even if it's objective and non confrontational, she pulls the ""*you don't know what you're talking about, you don't have kids*"" card.). She's also spoiling her kids in an impressive manner (we didn't have much in our youth, might come from that). When he does something bad she punished him by removing something he likes (Xbox, bike, ....) but it never lasts the full duration and the kid's not stupid, he knows.

Back to the kid, and the problem.

He failed every class this year. Even PE, where he usually really shines. And some scores show he's not even trying. I'm sure there's an underlying cause which is not especially related to his hyperactivity, I know my sister has been fighting a lot with her husband, she's very much on her phone all the time, doesn't take time to play with them. We offered the kids a few board games, they love it when we visit because we love board games thus we play a lot with them and they always ask if we brought games. My sister never really plays with them.

He's not stupid or dumb, when he puts his mind into it, he does well in school. When he wants to.

Now I'm the opposite of my sister, I've always been. I know he respects me and loves me (not saying he doesn't love my sister here). And I wanted to take the opportunity of the car trip (we'll be driving for about 3 hours just the two of us over the weekend and about the same with my wife, which he respects a lot too, so 6 hours total).

I know some meaningful discussions had a lot of impact on me when I was his age (or even younger) and I'd like to try the same while he's with me. The car is a great opportunity (or so I've read somewhere) because I'm not looking at him directly and he might open up more.

I'm also aware the problem might not be entirely coming from him.

I don't want him to turn against his parents. I don't want to reeducate him. I'd like to pep talk him into some sense, something he can ponder on, something that will resonate with him.

Should I just try to have him open up to me or what are some subjects I should try to discuss with him?

When he does something bad she punished him by removing something he likes (Xbox, bike, ....) but it never lasts the full duration and the kid&amp;#39;s not stupid, he knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the kid, and the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He failed every class this year. Even PE, where he usually really shines. And some scores show he&amp;#39;s not even trying. I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s an underlying cause which is not especially related to his hyperactivity, I know my sister has been fighting a lot with her husband, she&amp;#39;s very much on her phone all the time, doesn&amp;#39;t take time to play with them. We offered the kids a few board games, they love it when we visit because we love board games thus we play a lot with them and they always ask if we brought games. My sister never really plays with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s not stupid or dumb, when he puts his mind into it, he does well in school. When he wants to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m the opposite of my sister, I&amp;#39;ve always been. I know he respects me and loves me (not saying he doesn&amp;#39;t love my sister here). And I wanted to take the opportunity of the car trip (we&amp;#39;ll be driving for about 3 hours just the two of us over the weekend and about the same with my wife, which he respects a lot too, so 6 hours total).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know some meaningful discussions had a lot of impact on me when I was his age (or even younger) and I&amp;#39;d like to try the same while he&amp;#39;s with me. The car is a great opportunity (or so I&amp;#39;ve read somewhere) because I&amp;#39;m not looking at him directly and he might open up more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also aware the problem might not be entirely coming from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want him to turn against his parents. I don&amp;#39;t want to reeducate him. I&amp;#39;d like to pep talk him into some sense, something he can ponder on, something that will resonate with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I just try to have him open up to me or what are some subjects I should try to discuss with him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any help&lt;/p&gt;

Whenever he babbles to me, I enthusiastically respond as though he added some tidbit to my ongoing conversation. I narrate things throughout the day— Mommy is washing the dishes, let’s let the dog out, come help Mommy do laundry, etc... He has a huge collection of books and I read to him for at least an hour every day— he has his favorites, so I always read those and then rotate the non-favorite books through the reading list just so I don’t go mad... it’s amazing how many kids books I can recite in my sleep... I try to have him interact with the story as we are reading it— if the book is about a mouse and bear I like to ask him to point to whatever character is being discussed on that page— sometimes he gets quite a bit of it right, and other times seemingly not at all. I purchased toddler word flash cards— he is interested in looking at the pictures, but no matter how many times I repeat the word and ask him to say it he doesn’t even attempt to say it.

He now only consistently says 7 words: all forms of Mommy, all forms of Daddy, baby, Wawa, Baba, pool, and car. He used to say dog, but I haven’t been able to get him to say that for quite a while now. For lack of a better explanation, he just does not seem interested in speaking words right now.

He said truck the first time my husband asked him to say it, but we can’t get him to repeat any of these words.

Our Pediatrician made a seemingly innocuous comment about the possibility of speech delays being caused by Autism. I felt that she was implying our son might have autism, but my husband disagrees... I’m even more convinced now that she was suggesting that it might be a possibility after I googled Autism and found that she had mentioned Autism after she had asked us all of the questions on the “Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised” questionnaire. Other than his speech delay he doesn’t have any of the other characteristics that are associated with autism.  Should I be more concerned?

Then I’m somewhat nervous about the Speech Therapy referral... I’d personally welcome any help and encouragement to get him to talk, but for the last year he has been pretty wary of adult strangers, and though it is lessening a bit, I’m trying to fathom how long it will take for him to even warm up to the Speech Therapist for there to be any evaluation and/or therapy??

I lnow this is a long story to share with strangers but i dont know where to turn. I was a naive teenager, had my first dd at 18 and separated from her dad when she was 1yo. Shortly after I married my new partner, dd2 was stillborn, 2 years later dd3 is born. (Ex) DH developed PTSD and ended up leaving when she was 18 months old. To keep a long story short, he lied in court saying I neglected the kids, i had enough evidence to prove that was false on the first court date and he was ordered to return kids. He begged for my forgiveness after court, explaining that he thought i was going to leave him and he couldn't risk losing another child. I forgave him that same day. Admits it was lies to marriage counsellor, we try to work things out.

 6 months later he does the same thing. This time it turns out there is undiagnosed mental health issues and drug addiction. Court orders supervised visitation while he's in rehab, i facilitate visits and daily calls. I request supervised visits are revoked when i can see he's doing well. New orders state shared parental responsibility and he gets 4 nights a fortnight with his child. He does not get access to non biological child other than when he visits. 

Orders have been in place for several years, we were the role model coparents. His mental health is off and on, in 6 years hes had four different jobs, started 3 uni degrees and a few stints on disability due to mental health. I studied for 2 years and did volunteer work then got my current job which ive held for 3 years and just got a promotion. Hes currently on disability and almost went to hospital due to mental health last month. I'm not perfect, i have a mental health condition too although mine just requires medication. He also has this diagnosis but his is more complex.

He met someone, 6 months later married them and they have been married a year now. Ive been with my partner for 6 years, getting married in 2 months. We have always been flexible in what days he has her and i often let him have her on my weekends if he wants her for something. 

Hes now informed me that he wants 50/50 'custody' and for her to go to a school half way between our houses (we live just over an hour apart). I already dislike the travel time she has to do on our current schedule but this proposition has her on a bus 13 hours a fortnight.   Bus pickup is at 7.30, 20 mins from my home, a 35 minute drive back from my other daughters school and then a 35 minute drive back to work, to not get there on time. My partner does school drop offs because i start work at 4am so i can be home to pick up kids at 3pm every day.  This also means the girls would be spending a lot less time together as they are no longer at the same school. His income is 16k, mine is 45k  fees are about 4k. If he can't pay his half i will have to pay them. Current school is free. Proposed school is definitely better than current, but there are other better schools closer to either of our houses. My partner and i both work close to our home, his wife has to fly to her job once every two weeks, airport is an hour from their home and 25 mins from ours. Not sure if hes studying, last i heard he was on break due to mental health but uni is half way between our houses. They live in that suburb because they enjoy the lifestyle. 

So ex wants us to go to mediation (legally required before court here) but has already booked an interview with said school on a day I'm at work. Has informed me that he will be filing urgent interim orders requesting she be moved to that school while we continue in court to come to an agreement. I have requested we start seeing a psych so they can get our history and give us actual best interest advice.  I have an appointment with a lawyer on friday but I'm asking here, although I've obviously given my biased story, am i being unreasonable?  I know he definitely is acting in what he thinks is her best interest (and it very well may be) but i get the feeling its not. Obviously the psych and lawyer will give professional advice but I'd like to hear what others think so i can work out if I'm reacting normally.

To keep a long story short, he lied in court saying I neglected the kids, i had enough evidence to prove that was false on the first court date and he was ordered to return kids. He begged for my forgiveness after court, explaining that he thought i was going to leave him and he couldn&amp;#39;t risk losing another child. I forgave him that same day. Admits it was lies to marriage counsellor, we try to work things out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6 months later he does the same thing. This time it turns out there is undiagnosed mental health issues and drug addiction. Court orders supervised visitation while he&amp;#39;s in rehab, i facilitate visits and daily calls. I request supervised visits are revoked when i can see he&amp;#39;s doing well. New orders state shared parental responsibility and he gets 4 nights a fortnight with his child. He does not get access to non biological child other than when he visits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orders have been in place for several years, we were the role model coparents. His mental health is off and on, in 6 years hes had four different jobs, started 3 uni degrees and a few stints on disability due to mental health. I studied for 2 years and did volunteer work then got my current job which ive held for 3 years and just got a promotion. Hes currently on disability and almost went to hospital due to mental health last month. I&amp;#39;m not perfect, i have a mental health condition too although mine just requires medication. He also has this diagnosis but his is more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He met someone, 6 months later married them and they have been married a year now. Ive been with my partner for 6 years, getting married in 2 months. We have always been flexible in what days he has her and i often let him have her on my weekends if he wants her for something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hes now informed me that he wants 50/50 &amp;#39;custody&amp;#39; and for her to go to a school half way between our houses (we live just over an hour apart). I already dislike the travel time she has to do on our current schedule but this proposition has her on a bus 13 hours a fortnight.   Bus pickup is at 7.30, 20 mins from my home, a 35 minute drive back from my other daughters school and then a 35 minute drive back to work, to not get there on time. My partner does school drop offs because i start work at 4am so i can be home to pick up kids at 3pm every day.  This also means the girls would be spending a lot less time together as they are no longer at the same school. His income is 16k, mine is 45k  fees are about 4k. If he can&amp;#39;t pay his half i will have to pay them. Current school is free. Proposed school is definitely better than current, but there are other better schools closer to either of our houses. My partner and i both work close to our home, his wife has to fly to her job once every two weeks, airport is an hour from their home and 25 mins from ours. Not sure if hes studying, last i heard he was on break due to mental health but uni is half way between our houses. They live in that suburb because they enjoy the lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So ex wants us to go to mediation (legally required before court here) but has already booked an interview with said school on a day I&amp;#39;m at work. Has informed me that he will be filing urgent interim orders requesting she be moved to that school while we continue in court to come to an agreement. I have requested we start seeing a psych so they can get our history and give us actual best interest advice.  I have an appointment with a lawyer on friday but I&amp;#39;m asking here, although I&amp;#39;ve obviously given my biased story, am i being unreasonable?  I know he definitely is acting in what he thinks is her best interest (and it very well may be) but i get the feeling its not. Obviously the psych and lawyer will give professional advice but I&amp;#39;d like to hear what others think so i can work out if I&amp;#39;m reacting normally.  Thanks for sticking with me if you read this far!&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe I was a shotty kid, I do admit that I had some attitude issues, which they completely overreact to (knowing that literally every kid I know has the same or even worse attitude with their parents and that my parents act like its not normal at all), by screaming at me, hitting me, spitting on me. Gladly the physical part is now gone, because they probably think I would retaliate (I'm 18 and I go to the gym a bunch, if that gives you an idea).

 I'm under a constant aura of stress when I'm near my parents, and now they are starting to accuse me of not interacting with them (enough\*\*), that I'm always holed up in my room (they know damn well that I'm not), that every time I interact with them I ALWAYS have an attitude, and that I hardly ever obey them anymore.

I actually TRY to interact and have friendly conversation with my parents, but obviously not enough for them. The second they see me NOT interacting with them, or when I'm in a not so great mood, that's where they draw their conclusions about how I act towards them. Every time I try to tell them that I try my best they ignore it and keep going on about how ""I wonder how you treat your friends, or your professors, or other adults. You'll never get a job with that attitude, and you need to learn how to make conversation."" Even though I have many friends, I'm a decent public speaker, I know how to make conversation on an awkward date. What they don't realize is the fact that they are practically the only people I show a bad attitude to, the only people that I can't generate the best conversation with. This in my opinion is due to how I've been conditioned by them over the 18 years of my life, that it's some psychological effect that has took its toll on me. BUT IDK!

Since now they're making me feel like a complete and utter dickhead, making me feel like absolute crap, ""because you barely interact with us and every time you do, you give us attitude,"" I'm about to confront them about the way that they raised me, that I strongly believe it's the way I've been conditioned to look at them not as just parents, but as overbearing rulers that I'm becoming tiresome of and that I don't want much to do with them. That I'm constantly under stress with them, and I don't even know why. That maybe this has been taking an emotional and psychological toll on me, only in terms with them.

Don't get me wrong, I do love my parents, respect them a lot, and I am very glad that they have catered me all this way, even paying for my college, and ensuring my well-being.

My son is dealing with his first ""bullying' issue.

He's 7 years old and just learning how to ride his bike he's also a little behind on his speech but doing great since starting school.

Well there is a kid in his Kindergarten class (who also lives in our apartment complex)

Almost everyday my husband has been taking our son out to practice riding his bike and everyday this kid comes over riding his bike by himself (no parents ever in sight ever- but that's none of my business)

Every time this kid sees my son he says mean things. like ""i'm six and your 7 and you don't know how to ride that's sad."" Or he makes fun of the way he talks and asks if he's dumb...

My son is starting to not want to ride his bike or go inside when he sees this kid coming.

I've already told my son to tell this kid next time he sees him not to be mean and don't say mean things.

I don't know if it's a case of maybe he doesn't know he's being mean. Sometimes people are oblivious unless they are told, he's also only 6.

Should I tell the kid next time I see him that if he is mean I will have to talk to his mom?

Should I not say anything to the kid and just go to his mom?

Should I tell the apartment manager about it and let her say something?

On one hand I feel bad for this kid because I never see his parents and he doesn't seem to have any friends, just rides around alone. He keeps asking my son if he wants to come and play. So I'm getting the feeling this kid just has no filter or wasn't taught not to make fun of people,

So DS is 9 months old and loving solid food. Dinner really isn't an issue but I'm having difficulties finding good lunch ideas.
He loves cream cheese and marmite sandwiches but he has them often. He also loves pasta but we tend to keep that just to dinner times.
We've tried scrambled eggs but he doesn't seem to like that very much.

Does anyone have an ideas or recipes that I can do for my LO? I really want to keep encouraging him to try loads of different things.

I have one child, so every stage is new to me. I'm overwhelmed by choosing a booster seat or what some call here in Canada a ""Stage 3 Car Seat"". I've read my country's guidelines for this and I've looked online and in a few stores (but not extensively) and I get the gist of it. My son is 40lbs and will be 5 next week. I know there's no rush to get him in a booster seat - they're always safest in a car seat, but he is growing out of his Stage 2 seat height-wise.

There seems to be a ton of choices for booster seats. There are ones that look identical to Stage 2 seats and others that just don't even look safe (I'm surprised there's such a range in one type of car seat). Also, I was half hoping the next stage car seat would not have to involve me doing most of the work to secure him -- he can't completely buckle himself in his current seat, but I was wondering if it's possible to get a booster so he can get himself buckled in (and I just check it to make sure it's done properly).

Just joined and first time posting, hope this is the right sub. 
Today I picked up my 2 year old (turned 2 in march) and was informed that he had an incident with biting another child. This habit seems to just have formed and is the third incident this week. Because there have been multiple incidents, they informed me that the next time it happens (and oh yes, it probably will) there will be a mandatory 1 to 2 day suspension. 

I understand that biting is unacceptable, but suspension seems a little drastic. I know it happens, but he is 4 months in to being a 2 year old and this behavior seems like a typical phase they go through. 

My question is, if he is suspended will my toddler understand why he isn't going to school? Will he be able to connect the biting from a previous day to being out of school the next day? I do talk with him, eye contact and all, and tell him why biting isn't okay. As far as the daycare goes, I'm not sure what they actually have done to prevent the behavior, and why after only 3 incidents they already have resorted to suspension. 

I'm just at a loss all around. How do I handle this situation? How do I get him to understand that he can't go around biting other kids? I did go out to buy a book called ""We Don't Eat our Classmates"", step in the right direction I hope

We are two Canadian privacy/surveillance scholars looking to write children's' books along with parental guides on internet privacy for kids (2-10)! We have a couple of questions for this community and are hoping you might be able to help us out.

1. What are your main concerns about what your kids do online? Do you feel you have a strong grasp on what they are doing; are you comfortable with it?
2. Is privacy something that you speak about with your kids in the context of the internet (i.e. the importance of not giving out personal information in certain contexts, how social media sites work, credit card security, etc.?)
3. What would you like to see in a book/guide like this?

I know that there are rules I have to follow while I'm under their roof. I want to continue respecting them. 

It's been hard recently. I have to constantly send photos of who I'm with and where I am (I also understand that this is for safety purposes). 

I also started dating and began being open with them of who I like and what we plan to do on the date. (compared to me hiding things from them in the past, I'm starting to open up to them). 

My mom made it clear that I am only allowed to go out once to twice a week. She did say she'd consider if some plans came up with friends- but generally the answer is still no (I tried in the past). 

I did give them reason to doubt me and not trust me in the past(about a year ago), but I am trying my best to be open with them and tell them where I go.  

Im in university currently working on both my bachelor's and master's. So far I try my best to have a social life and balance everything.  I have a 2 week summer break and wish that I could spend it with friends and the guy I'm currently dating (who already graduated university and is currently working).

I do believe that I am old enough to make my own decisions and to make sure I don't put myself in dangerous situation or getting pregnant while in university. 
 
my mom was 21 when she had me, so I understand her concern- side:I do wish she would consider that there are safe options to avoid pregnancy like BCP (I'm currently on BCP) or an IUD , let alone condoms to avoid STD and lower risk of pregnancy) - rather than hiding behind abstinence and chastity. 

I just wish she respected me too. Though it does sound like I just want to go out whenever I wanted, I do want this but I am also aware of responsibilities I have at home, school, and work. 

She does get angry- I pointed out that I would appreciate it if she would not yell when I make a mistake because this does not create a safe space for progress and communication. She responded  by saying that she can't change that part of her... 

Another thing is that she always tells me to fix my attitude because I can get moody or standoffish and im trying to do my best I don't put her off and all that- but she wouldn't consider trying to be more approachable or even understanding. 

I don't know her complete side of her perspective but I do take into account the things she says and use them to my advantage to make sure I do better for myself.

Sorry for the length of my rant and for any English mistakes (not my first language).

My mom is an architect that offers services in decoration, but she hardly finds any clients, gets paid little, and accepts to do stuff a decorator doesn’t even do like fixing the electric systems, etc. She sets no boundaries for the sake of a little more money and gets overworked. A lot.

My mom’s business is a mess. She has no consistency, no protocol and is overall too insecure to do networking outside her friend circle. I already designed a graphic line for her, written a work contract and created a FB page and explained her several times how to use it. The problem is she still won’t do any of this because she tells me “I don’t know how to do it. I need your help”. She also asks me to write her speeches for workshops and asks me if she should work with this guy, or that woman, what should she show this other client, etc. She’s very insecure.

But at the same time I feel SO guilty when she comes to me and tells me everything that is not OK financially in our family (just her and me), how overworked she is because she keeps making the same mistakes and how “You are so good at this. You are a genius with the computer. Would you please help me with my Facebook? I need your help. I am so glad to have you as my daughter. We are a team”. Maybe I could really fix all of this but it feels like the one in control over HER business would be me and I don’t like the feeling of that. I would like to put my time into my full time college life and my own projects which are definitely not home decor.

Is there a way I could help her get out from her hole without me getting sucked into it as well? Or should I find a “work counselor” for her? (If there is such a thing, idk).

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I have been home (UK), I have been involved with my brothers somehow. For two summers before, my Dad 'employed' me as an au pair for them and paid me for the work I did. I play with them and keep them entertained; baking, taking them to the park, swimming, just as much as I can to keep them off their tablets/phones. (I can't believe they have their own tech so young, but that's another issue).

&amp;#x200B;

It's just such a hostile environment, I feel like I'm damage control to these boys. Whatever my Dad and his wife have done in the way of discipline, it definitely hasn't worked. Usually they use smacking the kids' hands and shouting at them, and it could be for the littlest thing. And, usually, he takes it out on the older kid while the younger one could **literally** get away with murder.

&amp;#x200B;

His wife is the angriest person I have ever met. She's from South-East Asia (not specifying for anonymity) and she uses that as an excuse to be a 'tiger mom'; most of her interactions with the kids are her screaming at them and making them cry. She'll even scream at my Dad in the middle of the night. (When she did this I knocked on the door asking her if she could stop screaming, because obviously the whole house is trying to sleep. She just got worse and started yelling at my Dad for 'not being able to control his daughter'.) She can't take any responsibility for her own actions, and always deflects the blame onto someone else (usually my Dad or her eldest son). We know she has depression and takes meds for that, and she has her own part-time job and we got her into gardening to try calm her down, which has worked a little bit. I've told my Dad that she needs to see a psychiatrist for her anger issues at least, but again, she doesn't think she's doing anything wrong so I sincerely doubt that would help. I know she's had some issues in her childhood but I don't think that's an excuse for what she is inflicting on her own children.

&amp;#x200B;

My Dad isn't innocent in this either. He's the primary caregiver most of the time, and does try to be a good parent when he has the energy. He doesn't shout as often, but he still smacks. He's especially hard on the older boy, and genuinely believes that the 9yo is the bully in the situation a lot of the time.

Here is my observation: my Dad and his wife bully the 9yo (making things out to be his fault), then the 9yo takes it out on the 5yo as a way to regain control maybe, but the 5yo bullies back. Then my Dad and his wife punish the 9yo for being a bully while letting the 5yo off with his behaviour.  If the kids are unhappy, they've learned that being hit and being shouted at is 'OK' but they can't hit or shout back, so they hit each other (and are then punished for it).

The 5yo is so manipulative, and keeps saying things like ""I'm the boss!"" ""You're not the boss of me."" ""You have to do what I say."" He's not getting corrected for this, and his parents usually do what he tells them to. He never says 'please' or 'thank you' unless prompted, and usually asks for things in the ""I want (X) NOW"" format. In other words; he's a proper brat and a demon child.

It's a vicious circle and I don't know how to stop it.

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment, my Dad isn't employing me and I'm instead just another occupant in the house. When I've been in charge, I've used the Time Out technique a few times (mainly on the 5yo because he's an actual demon) and it works. I had to repeat the cycle 5 times the first time I used it, but now when I give him a warning for his behaviour he takes me seriously and pipes down. Sometimes even when I'm not in charge, when I see that his parents don't do anything I tend to discipline instead. (Which ends up being a much quicker and calmer affair than when they do it).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm disappointed for the 5yo because he's not learning proper behaviour and turning into a demon child, but I'm scared for the 9yo. My heart breaks for him. Dad's wife got an 8-ball for Christmas, and I saw the 9yo playing with it when noone was looking. Do you know what he asked it: ""Does my mummy love me?"" NO CHILD should have to feel like that and it kills me. It makes me want to cry as I'm typing this. Most days I'm just trying to work out if it's acceptable for me to kidnap him and raise him as my own.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel at such a loss here. I don't know what to do, or who to ask for help.

&amp;#x200B;

Given that they are my brothers, and not my children (but it's still my Dad raising them), what power do I have in this situation?

&amp;#x200B;

Usually they use smacking the kids&amp;#39; hands and shouting at them, and it could be for the littlest thing. And, usually, he takes it out on the older kid while the younger one could &lt;strong&gt;literally&lt;/strong&gt; get away with murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His wife is the angriest person I have ever met. She&amp;#39;s from South-East Asia (not specifying for anonymity) and she uses that as an excuse to be a &amp;#39;tiger mom&amp;#39;; most of her interactions with the kids are her screaming at them and making them cry. She&amp;#39;ll even scream at my Dad in the middle of the night. (When she did this I knocked on the door asking her if she could stop screaming, because obviously the whole house is trying to sleep. She just got worse and started yelling at my Dad for &amp;#39;not being able to control his daughter&amp;#39;.) She can&amp;#39;t take any responsibility for her own actions, and always deflects the blame onto someone else (usually my Dad or her eldest son). We know she has depression and takes meds for that, and she has her own part-time job and we got her into gardening to try calm her down, which has worked a little bit. I&amp;#39;ve told my Dad that she needs to see a psychiatrist for her anger issues at least, but again, she doesn&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;s doing anything wrong so I sincerely doubt that would help. I know she&amp;#39;s had some issues in her childhood but I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s an excuse for what she is inflicting on her own children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Dad isn&amp;#39;t innocent in this either. He&amp;#39;s the primary caregiver most of the time, and does try to be a good parent when he has the energy. He doesn&amp;#39;t shout as often, but he still smacks. He&amp;#39;s especially hard on the older boy, and genuinely believes that the 9yo is the bully in the situation a lot of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my observation: my Dad and his wife bully the 9yo (making things out to be his fault), then the 9yo takes it out on the 5yo as a way to regain control maybe, but the 5yo bullies back. Then my Dad and his wife punish the 9yo for being a bully while letting the 5yo off with his behaviour.  If the kids are unhappy, they&amp;#39;ve learned that being hit and being shouted at is &amp;#39;OK&amp;#39; but they can&amp;#39;t hit or shout back, so they hit each other (and are then punished for it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 5yo is so manipulative, and keeps saying things like &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m the boss!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not the boss of me.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You have to do what I say.&amp;quot; He&amp;#39;s not getting corrected for this, and his parents usually do what he tells them to. He never says &amp;#39;please&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;thank you&amp;#39; unless prompted, and usually asks for things in the &amp;quot;I want (X) NOW&amp;quot; format. In other words; he&amp;#39;s a proper brat and a demon child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a vicious circle and I don&amp;#39;t know how to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, my Dad isn&amp;#39;t employing me and I&amp;#39;m instead just another occupant in the house. When I&amp;#39;ve been in charge, I&amp;#39;ve used the Time Out technique a few times (mainly on the 5yo because he&amp;#39;s an actual demon) and it works. I had to repeat the cycle 5 times the first time I used it, but now when I give him a warning for his behaviour he takes me seriously and pipes down. Sometimes even when I&amp;#39;m not in charge, when I see that his parents don&amp;#39;t do anything I tend to discipline instead. (Which ends up being a much quicker and calmer affair than when they do it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m disappointed for the 5yo because he&amp;#39;s not learning proper behaviour and turning into a demon child, but I&amp;#39;m scared for the 9yo. My heart breaks for him. Dad&amp;#39;s wife got an 8-ball for Christmas, and I saw the 9yo playing with it when noone was looking. Do you know what he asked it: &amp;quot;Does my mummy love me?&amp;quot; NO CHILD should have to feel like that and it kills me. It makes me want to cry as I&amp;#39;m typing this. Most days I&amp;#39;m just trying to work out if it&amp;#39;s acceptable for me to kidnap him and raise him as my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just feel at such a loss here. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do, or who to ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that they are my brothers, and not my children (but it&amp;#39;s still my Dad raising them), what power do I have in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parents of Reddit, how should I approach this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

(Works as a vet tech, i mentioned this because it is emotionally and physically stressful). Has no love towards herself and cant move past it, often fantasizing about her death and how she would do it (constantly doubting her life and worth)

Extremely depressed, has seen several therapist and psychologist.

Where she became physically abusive directly towards me.

 the son is a trans teen has severe depression and physiological issues fantasizes practices light suicidal habits (has a therapist &amp; psychologist) have been to over all 6 months of school in 2 years total.

So we lived together for almost a year, in that time i learned her patterns and was able to keep her and her ""son"" from destroying themselves and giving up on life. This cascaded into lies, sneaking booze, affairs, bad judgement calls and lots of drunk fights she cant remember but i have proof of these  actions. So i still love her and wish to take care  if not her the my daughter, her family know about her problems and are in favor of me being  directly in their lives. But just recently behind my back she rented an apartment. Her apartment is in the downtown core walking distances to many bars and nightclubs, which sent a red flag to everyone who knows her condition. 

Now her claim is to find her old self when she was a good mother. And prove to herself that she is a good mother without my help. To be honest she barely made it a week and was drunk, she left her underaged tween alone a few times (this worries me because she believes he will watch her) this bugs me because he doesn't go to class, he doesn't want to work, he only will do things if it favors him in some way or if he benfits, and doesn't clean or take responsibility, and the mother knows all this but has a weird way of not disciplining or caves into his stubbornness and starts to feel bad or guilty....sorry this bugs my because he/she is a role model to my daughter  and is already picking bad habits. 

Dont get me wrong the last thing i wanna do it seperate her from mother. (This was the root of many fights) inalso feel like she is slowly trying to ween me out of her life.
Children sevices have been involed but not on my behalf but through the tweens truancy records and an episode on night between the mother and tween. They did ask about my toddler but she didnt give them information on me and kinda evaded my existence, however ther did call me to get a hold of her a few times.

Now im at the point in my life where i want to move but i want my daughter indefinitely in my life.there have been threats to move her away but they were said while she was intoxicated. 

I dont know what to do should i tell child services my side of things to be cautious in cause she has a falling out, should i just ignore and put in good faith she will be the best for her and become the mother she sees herself as, i still love her but as the creator of my child, but i don't trust her actions or her word.

for background, i am a 17 year old girl, my parents are together, and we all live together (basically they aren’t unhappy or split up)

my mother loves to stalk me and pick apart every single little thing i do on social media.

recently, my tiktok account (an app where you can lip sync to songs and make fun videos, it’s very teen friendly) blew up and i gained a lot of followers !! it was really cool. then i showed my mom.

the video that got me followers was an innocent video of me cosplaying, which my mom liked. what my mom didn’t like ? was that my account was public. mind you i’m 17.

i overheard my mom talking to my dad about how 2000 people are following me, and that she thinks a bunch of them are traffickers or perverts, and she sounded angry. it made me really upset, as i’m scared that she’s going to make me set my tiktok account on private.

on tiktok, people can only message you if you’re following them and they’re following you. the only people i happen to do that with are my 2 friends, who my mom knows and likes.

what do i do ?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;a couple weeks ago i posted on this thread asking for advice, and i got a lot of great answers !! but now, parents of reddit, i need help again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for background, i am a 17 year old girl, my parents are together, and we all live together (basically they aren’t unhappy or split up)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my mother loves to stalk me and pick apart every single little thing i do on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;recently, my tiktok account (an app where you can lip sync to songs and make fun videos, it’s very teen friendly) blew up and i gained a lot of followers !! it was really cool. then i showed my mom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the video that got me followers was an innocent video of me cosplaying, which my mom liked. what my mom didn’t like ? was that my account was public. mind you i’m 17.&lt;/p&gt;

However, I really want to change this for the future (maybe for age 25-30?). My reasons include:

1. I have really bad anxiety and a hard time managing my own emotions. I need a LOT of time to myself,  and I feel a kid would infringe on that. I can’t imagine coming home from a 9-5 only to be met with another job of raising a kid. If I feel I can’t even take care of myself, how on earth am I going to handle being responsible for another human being?

2. I HATE working and have absolutely no desire to work more than what it would take to support myself. Basically, I want to work the bare minimum due to my anxiety being so bad. To be financially responsible for someone else is a major lifestyle change and I would enjoy having more disposable income. 

3. I want more alone time with my future husband. I don’t want to have to schedule time for us to just lay in bed alone and cuddle and be intimate. I don’t want to be put second in my husband’s mind because children must come first. But the reality is that your children do become the priority (and rightfully so, but I’m just saying it sounds a little miserable)

Those are my top reasons. The reason I want to change my mind? My boyfriend of 1 year is on the same page with me on EVERYTHING. We have everything in common....except for this. He wants kids and I don’t. Other than that, he is perfect for me. He has tried exposing himself to articles on how people have regretted having kids and trying to understand the drawbacks to having them, but it hasn’t changed his mind. To be fair, I haven’t tried changing my mind so that’s what I am intending to do here. At least become open minded about the positives on having kids. 

Is it possible? I have no fucking clue, but I’m assuming it’s at least more possible for me to change my mind than for him because it’s much more “normal” to want kids. It’s abnormal to not want them. So I guess I need to be the one to change here. I don’t want to throw an entire relationship that’s otherwise excellent in the trash over ONE dilemma. So I figure I need to at least make an effort to be open minded to the positives about parenthood. He is also open to us adopting and only having one child, which I think makes a BIG difference because pregnancy and childbirth are a whole other can of worms I will never warm up to. But adoption is much better, the only roadblock is getting myself to warm up to actually raising a kid. 

(Not to mention as a side note: most men want kids. Even if we did break up, which I am not even entertaining right now, I would run into this issue time and time again. Better to work on myself to accommodate my current relationship as it is going so well and we have began planning out our future together)

I am looking for advice about whether to ask grandma to be nanny or to put LO into daycare.  This is our first and I will be going back to work fulltime when he is ~7 months old (❤️❤️ my employer!).

My mom is willing to nanny and this seems like a good option for his care.  The reason I’m not sure is that she has always been WAY too emotionally dependent/needy toward me and my siblings (codependent I’d say).  I feel like she is already starting to act this way toward our LO (first grandkid on both sides, poor kid).  I feel like she is trying to relive her ‘mom days’ and she keeps reminding me those were the best years of her life.  She doesn’t have much else going on and has been more or less waiting for us to give her grandkids.  My 2 siblings and I all moved across the country probably largely due to her pressure on us for emotional connection.  I am now moving back so that we can have more family support (my inlaws are also there and are lovely).  I think if she is his nanny she will completely re-order her life around him in an unhealthy obsessive way.  

I know he is just a baby so won’t be too affected for at least a few years, so should I just ignore that it bothers me and kind of freaks me out as it is probably better for him to get such loving 1-1 care?  Or compromise and do it until he is a bit older then switch to daycare?  

The daycare is supposed to be great and both options are financially reasonable, so it just is about what would be best for LO and myself and partner.  Worried there may be some boundary issues with her kind of trying to be his mom (not necessarily not following our parenting choices, more like her trying to have his first word be “nana” and be the one he goes to for comfort, etc).

I feel like she is already starting to act this way toward our LO (first grandkid on both sides, poor kid).  I feel like she is trying to relive her ‘mom days’ and she keeps reminding me those were the best years of her life.  She doesn’t have much else going on and has been more or less waiting for us to give her grandkids.  My 2 siblings and I all moved across the country probably largely due to her pressure on us for emotional connection.  I am now moving back so that we can have more family support (my inlaws are also there and are lovely).  I think if she is his nanny she will completely re-order her life around him in an unhealthy obsessive way.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know he is just a baby so won’t be too affected for at least a few years, so should I just ignore that it bothers me and kind of freaks me out as it is probably better for him to get such loving 1-1 care?  Or compromise and do it until he is a bit older then switch to daycare?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The daycare is supposed to be great and both options are financially reasonable, so it just is about what would be best for LO and myself and partner.  Worried there may be some boundary issues with her kind of trying to be his mom (not necessarily not following our parenting choices, more like her trying to have his first word be “nana” and be the one he goes to for comfort, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice or thoughts are welcome and much appreciated!!&lt;/p&gt;

I'm just tired of dealing with BS. I did try posting to r/Parenting, but apparently the mods think that you have to be a biological parent to post there to ask for help.

As a TL;DR, I have a 4 year old sister who I fear will grow up to have a lot of social problems/mental issues because of the way she is treated in our family. In general, I feel our family dynamic is incredibly toxic.

I'm 20 years old, and her only brother, for what that's worth. Our immediate family consists of my father and my other three sisters. My mother unfortunately passed two years ago. My grandma also contributes to her care-taking as well.

Also, for what it's worth, none of us siblings really asked for, or were ready for a sister, let alone attempting to raise her. I believe that it has made my sisters resentful of her, as she is often ""pawned off"" on them in my opinion. I try to be considerate of the fact that our youngest sister didn't ask for this situation either, and is even more lost than we are in all likelihood.

I'll start by listing our respective styles of interacting with her, and finish by listing her behavior as of recently.

Me: I try my best to do everything ""by the book,"" try giving her warnings, rewards, spending time with her, timeouts, etc. She doesn't seem all to interested in me, as she quickly wants to spend more time with my sisters, specifically the second oldest. I believe she finds them more similar to her than I am to her, and she thinks she can do more with them than I can with her. I was also not really permitted to take care of her when she was younger but did my best to spend time with her. I don't think my methods work well as she has 4 other people with different methods she always goes to when ""I'm being mean."" I've raised my voice, but never yelling, and never intentionally hurtful. I try to reward her for good behavior, and give her timeout/ silent treatment for bad, but I'm not sure if I'm doing that right. In the past I've messed up pretty badly, and will go into more detail depending on anyone that asks.

Father: My father, is in my opinion, a responsible parent, but not much else. Just based off of my own personal experience, I've never really seen him as someone to go to for help, advice, to talk to, etc. He is incredibly negative sometimes, and is very good at bumming me out. The reason I'm bringing that up is because this is how he treats my sister, in a sense. He doesn't really spend time with her because he doesn't really know how, but will always make sure she's fed, clothed, clean, and in otherwise good health. He spoils her by always taking her side in almost every tantrum she throws and gives her whatever she wants. He will sometimes raise his voice at her, actually yelling, but that is very rare. He usually pawns her off on my sisters, in my opinion.

Mother: Though she died, when she was alive, my mother was afflicted with a debilitating cancer. She spent as much time with my sister as possible, but there was only so much she could do. As a result and a very easy way out, she gave my sister an iPad to watch Youtube Kids on. Since then she does not really part with it and everyone in the family just gives it to her out of frustration. I tried to warn my mother, but I couldn't convince anyone that that was a bad thing to do. She was the person out of the family who gave her the most attention when she could, however.

Grandmother: I will make no secret of the disdain I hold for how my grandmother cares for my sister. From what I've been told, my grandmother is old-world and believes that a literal slap on the wrist is alright for discipline, and she also spoils my sister heavily. This is all what I've heard but the people who have told me that do not have any compelling reason to lie to me about it.

Sister (Eldest): This sister is easily the most authoritarian out of my whole family. She is very strict/straight-forward with our little sister. Her version of timeout is closing the door of a room (with nothing dangerous in the room) and staying on the other side. She has a no BS attitude, and it doesn't really mix well with our little sister's defiant, childish attitude. She does yell at her, but never in any malicious or cruel way. This sister does not mix well with people questioning her methods, and will often take care of our sister just to spite people sometimes.

Sister (2nd): This sister is very happy go lucky in terms of personality. Whereas everyone else in my family is relatively serious, she is not. This leads to her being able to bond very well with our younger sister, to the point that she (4 year old) prefers spending time with only her. My sister is not able to handle this on a consistent basis in the slightest. This leads to sister 2 being cold sometimes, and pawning her off to one of us or just putting her on her iPad. This also leads to her spoiling her the most, and basically jumping to conclusions in situations like our sister hitting someone and being told to go to timeout, and then just telling her to say sorry and it'll be okay.

Sister (3rd): This sister makes no secret that she has a noticeable temper and warns us that when she loses it she does stupid things, and she can't control it sometimes. In my opinion sister 3 has the worst relationship with our sister out of the three. She has yelled at our youngest sister, told her mean things like ""Nobody likes you,"" and is the least accommodating of her in general.

Youngest sister's behavior at this point:

My youngest sister at this point is pretty happy go lucky, and also extremely defiant. If you tell her to stop doing something, she will sometimes treat it like a joke, even if you get angry with her. In fact, the angrier you get, the funnier she seems to think it is. Timeout is impossible, because she never sits still long enough or takes it seriously enough to stay in it. When she throws tantrums, she has started slamming doors, yelling at the top of her lungs, and justifying it with ""They were mean to me"" even though I've taught her time and time again to come talk to me or one of us instead of that. She uses the word no a lot, and always wants things her way. I'm not sure how much of this is normal behavior and how much isn't. She lives with basically no rules, which I'm very against. She eats whatever she wants and doesn't go to bed at consistent times. She also still sleeps with my sisters/dad. I'm very against that, because she should learn how to sleep on her own, but my dad says she needs more time. My sisters want the same, but I feel they only say that because it would benefit them with better sleep.

I want her to grow up happy and better than we did, and I feel very guilty anytime I see her, knowing that we might screw her up. At the same time, I'm lost, because everyone seems to have different ideas for taking care of her, and at this point it has become easier to just cave and not have to deal with the headache that comes with trying to convince my family of certain things.

My dad (mid 50s) is not dealing very well with it. He and I aren't very close, but there have been some very obvious signs of his depression. My family's predisposed to it - my grandmother has depression, and one of my sisters has experienced boughts of it too. As have I.

It's been almost 6 months since my grandfather died, or it will be next week. My dad has mentioned to my boyfriend (pretty much a stranger to him) that he's been depressed. To my youngest (seven year old) sister, he said that he was dying as he lay in bed. He terrified her. He's mentioned it to pretty much everyone in our family-friends group, but has also added that that's how he felt in the past.

He said that he was able to get over dying by focusing on the book he's writing about his dad. I'm not sure how close he is to finishing it, but he's reached out to people who knew his dad to make additions to his own words.

I said that my dad and I aren't very close, but the truth is we may as well be estranged. He doesn't speak to me about anything of substance, and hasn't since I was probably a child or a teenager. I'm 24 now. He's never told me he loves me. The last time I received a hug from him was maybe five years ago? I don't remember.

The last time we spoke, he asked me to lend him $3k (which I gave to him and my mom) and also asked my sister (who is still in university and in $20k debt from it) for $2k, to help him travel back to his mother country around the anniversary of my grandfather's death.

His diet has changed. He eats less than he used to, and has lost a fair bit of weight. This is part of his religion, though. When your parents die, you mourn for a year and in that time you're only allowed bland food (rice, vegetables, no salt, etc.). But it's been 6 months, and I think that's when psychologists say you should seek help for dealing with grief.

My uncle tried to reach out to me yesterday to speak with me. I'm the eldest child of the eldest child in this family. That means that I need to step up and make an effort... But I don't know what to do. I don't know what I need to make an effort for. I'm afraid.

If my dad dies from his depression, I can't support my family on my 30k salary. My parents have a 250k mortgage that they are still paying off. I can't raise my seven-year-old sister. I can't help my 21 year old sister finish her school. I want to move out and live with my boyfriend, and I feel like that would be delayed. My mom doesn't really talk to me about my dad's mental health. I don't know if my dad would even see anyone for his depression, if I asked it of him. It's not in the norm in his culture to seek help for mental health issues.

I wrote a lot, and I still feel like I'm not done writing. My uncle is going to be calling me tonight, and I'm not sure what to say.

He doesn&amp;#39;t speak to me about anything of substance, and hasn&amp;#39;t since I was probably a child or a teenager. I&amp;#39;m 24 now. He&amp;#39;s never told me he loves me. The last time I received a hug from him was maybe five years ago? I don&amp;#39;t remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time we spoke, he asked me to lend him $3k (which I gave to him and my mom) and also asked my sister (who is still in university and in $20k debt from it) for $2k, to help him travel back to his mother country around the anniversary of my grandfather&amp;#39;s death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His diet has changed. He eats less than he used to, and has lost a fair bit of weight. This is part of his religion, though. When your parents die, you mourn for a year and in that time you&amp;#39;re only allowed bland food (rice, vegetables, no salt, etc.). But it&amp;#39;s been 6 months, and I think that&amp;#39;s when psychologists say you should seek help for dealing with grief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My uncle tried to reach out to me yesterday to speak with me. I&amp;#39;m the eldest child of the eldest child in this family. That means that I need to step up and make an effort... But I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I don&amp;#39;t know what I need to make an effort for. I&amp;#39;m afraid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my dad dies from his depression, I can&amp;#39;t support my family on my 30k salary. My parents have a 250k mortgage that they are still paying off. I can&amp;#39;t raise my seven-year-old sister. I can&amp;#39;t help my 21 year old sister finish her school. I want to move out and live with my boyfriend, and I feel like that would be delayed. My mom doesn&amp;#39;t really talk to me about my dad&amp;#39;s mental health. I don&amp;#39;t know if my dad would even see anyone for his depression, if I asked it of him. It&amp;#39;s not in the norm in his culture to seek help for mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a lot, and I still feel like I&amp;#39;m not done writing. My uncle is going to be calling me tonight, and I&amp;#39;m not sure what to say. I feel so lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

For the past couple of years, my wife and I have been on her insurance. I am offered great insurance in my current position but the premiums are astronomically high. As a result, I waived my offered insurance and took my spouses. However, I recently went from a contract position to a full-time position with significantly lower premiums.  Here's the tricky part: 

&amp;nbsp;

I don't start my new position until August 1st, but the baby is due within the week. When the baby is born, it will trigger a qualifying event. I've learned through my HR that I don't have to pay the premium if the qualifying event occurs after the 16th of the month, and when August comes along, I'll only have to pay the lower premium associated with the full-time position. 

&amp;nbsp;

From an insurance perspective, when does the qualifying event actually take place? Right when the baby is born? All activities up to the birth on a specific day? Essentially I want to know if the care for my wife on the day(s) of the birth will be covered by my new insurance or if it will be applied to her current insurance.

Thank you in advance - I appreciate any insight from anyone that's gone through something similar!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

This isnt some tantrum where she will cave after a few minutes, this is full on panic mode when we enter the shower.

I went to a doctor to check if something was wrong with her ears/eyes and got nothing, she will go into a pool no problem, beach again no problem the thing is the shower.

I currently have my own apartment, but we're planning to move in together near the end of this month, so I don't really stay there anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Her ex has a weird job schedule and so we end up having her daughter 3-5 days out of the week.

&amp;#x200B;

Because it's summer, her grandparents or her dad usually has her during the day when we are at work, and we'll have her at night on nights that she stays with us.

&amp;#x200B;

Her daughter goes to bed around 8-8:30, and when it's time for bed, she always runs and jumps onto our bed and says she wants to sleep there that night. It's 100% of the time she actually tries to sleep in the same bed. My girlfriend doesn't always allow it, but there are exceptions. One being when she hasn't had her for a while, because she's been on vacation and she misses her, then she'll let her..and I don't really have any problem with that - I totally get it.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is that her daughter doesn't see it as an exception, and that it's just more of the norm. When my girlfriend and her ex split up, she moved into an apartment (then later bought a house), and her and her daughter would regularly sleep in the same bed. I think because of the circumstances surrounding their separation (she pretty much just walked out because it was beyond over), she feels immensely guilty and doesn't want to be seen as a bad parent.

&amp;#x200B;

A night doesn't go by that her daughter doesn't try at least one tactic to get into bed with us - she ""had a bad dream"" or ""is afraid of the dark"" etc. Sometimes it'll be early AM (2-4 AM) where she'll come in our room and try to get into bed with us.. other times it will be a bit after we've put her down, she'll come in saying she can't sleep but I feel like it's almost always a way to try and get into bed with us.  Just last night she asked while I was sitting there, when will I not be there so she can sleep in the same bed as her mom.

&amp;#x200B;

This whole situation feels really complex - maybe her daughter is dealing with feelings of me coming between them/taking her mom away from her, or that she thinks her mom's love for her can go away like it did with her dad - I don't really know. She lets her daughter get away with a lot and only cracks down when she's (her daughter) absolutely flipped her shit - her daughter doesn't have any manners (hits, chews loudly with mouth open, loudly licks/sucks fingers when eating, smacks us on the butt, farts and announces it,  etc) and her mom doesn't do anything about it. Is this just how kids act, and it's okay to let them do that because they'll grow out of it, or should she be doing more to curb these behaviors? I realize there are multiple things in this post.. but I'm just venting.

I say stuff like &amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m gonna leave for college and never talk to him again.&amp;quot; I honestly don&amp;#39;t mean it, I&amp;#39;m just venting. I write most of these down and send them as a text to my other brother and he knows I don&amp;#39;t mean anything by it. Just recently he took my phone and saw all the stuff I have said about him and he is really upset at me. He said I&amp;#39;m ungrateful (which I&amp;#39;m not) and was being disrespectful to him and now my mom is upset at me as well. My question is: Is it okay to say bad things about someone even though you don&amp;#39;t mean them and was just upset? Because if I meant it I would say it to his face and most of what I said were just jokes. Thank you all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you all for the advice and I&amp;#39;ll tell you how it goes :)&lt;/p&gt;

I spent a few years desperately wanting a baby, but I’ve never seen it as just having a baby--it’s raising a fellow human being who will eventually go out into the world and hopefully have a positive impact. 

I was an only child, had zero cousins, was never around other kids growing up. Now that I am an adult, I have one niece from my husband’s side of the family. I’ve known her since she was born, but only spent significant time with her in the last few years due to the states we all lived in (she is nine now). This is the second year in a row she has come to spend a few weeks during the summer with us, and both experiences have made me question absolutely everything about myself, my capabilities, and my future.

To be clear, I appear to be her favorite aunt, and I love her unconditionally, but she is a very difficult kid right now. At 8 last year, and 9 this year, the selfishness she displays is through the roof. I expect a kid to not necessarily think about others all the time, but her attitude about life is basically that the world revolves around her. My husband and I take her to amusement parks and buy her gifts and we don’t even get a thank you, and the following day, when we want to have a “downtime day” she whines that we’re not doing anything, and asks me to buy her things on Amazon. I gently remind her of all the fun we had yesterday and that we have a mini trip planned tomorrow, but she doesn’t care--she’s not getting the thing she wants right now, and basically woe is her, the world is awful, blah blah.

I get that some of this is my fault: we do too much so her expectations are high, but I feel as though I’ve set some healthy boundaries this year and things have not changed much from last year. So I wonder--is this just how kids are? Is there a set of ages where they’re the worst? I know not EVERY kid is like this because I know that as a child myself I wasn’t like this, and I’ve met plenty (albeit for short periods of time) that are polite, gracious, and kind. Of course kids are having a whole host of emotions that they are having trouble dealing with and they’re not going to be “good” all the time--adults certainly aren’t! 

But, parents, can you tell me: is your experience with your own children better than the ones with other people’s kids? Or is every day a struggle that’s “worth it” at the end of the day? After two weeks with my niece I feel depressed, used, angry, confused, but I also feel a little loved and appreciated. Is that your every day?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents, can you tell me about your experience with other people’s children before having your own?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to not want kids when I was a kid up through high school, but I also didn’t want to get married--this was all tied to my experience with my own mother who resented me for existing.

Towards the end of last school year, two things happened: 1- they got pretty close to another girl in the class who doesn’t like my daughter (my girl is oblivious and thinks they are friends, too) and 2- a girl a year older moved into the house between us and has joined the friend group.

Over the last couple of months, it has started to look as though my daughter’s friends are only interested in playing with her when no one else is available otherwise it’s “out of sight, out of mind” and the cattiness has taken on a middle school level. They used to come over so often to play that it was getting to be too much. Now we hardly see them. Summer… no school… and they were hardly seen.

That stung and kind of pissed me off. Maybe I’m too sensitive… that’s, of course, a possibility in all this, too.

There’s a concert this Friday near my house. We were thinking of going with another friend from school. Problem is, I’m already scheduled to work from 10:45 to 8 that day. I asked my mom about asking for a replacement after 4, so I could work for the better part of the day and they would only have to find someone for the last 4. She almost immediately rebuffed it, on the grounds that I’m always asking for more hours(the company hired a ton of lifeguards on the assumption that everyone only wanted half the hours they said they wanted), so it would look bad if I asked for a replacement, on top of the fact that like 3 weeks ago I got sick at work and they had to send me home. I think she’s also a bit turned off by the fact that it’s Wiz Khalifa so there’s gonna be a ton of weed there(which I have absolutely no intention of doing) and she’s super against it since she’s still a part of the whole “it’s very possible to overdose on marijuana” crowd.

i am a good kid. i don’t do drugs, i don’t drink, i just like my privacy. i was always a kid that liked having my own time and space, most likely because i was a very sheltered only child. the only problem is that i have ADD so i have trouble in classes at school, but i never have bad behavior, it’s just my grades that drop even though i try my best, and i cry frequently at school.

I wasn't even sure if I even wanted to go, but I saw no other option at the time. I was studying Biology. I went for three years. I was three years into my Biology degree. I was doing poorly. My GPA was a 2.5. I kept getting C's and D's in my major classes, and even failed a few. It took me three years to realize that Biology isn't something I have an interest in and isn't for me. I was upset with myself that I wasted three years of college wasting my time and money on a degree I didn't want.

I lost my scholarships due to being unable to maintain the GPA requirements. I piled up 18k of student loan debt.

I admit, I wasn't ready for college after high school. My mother pressured me to go. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life and I still don't. I picked Biology because I was always kind of good in science. I had no intentions to go to medical school or any other graduate school.

I decided that I wanted to take a break from school and work, mature, and get my head straight. I've never had a job before. I kept putting off getting a job due to having bad Social Anxiety, but I can't keep putting off getting a job any longer because I am getting older and it's going to look even more odd that I've never had a job the longer I put off getting one (Especially if I'm not going to be in school). And I know to tackle my Social Anxiety problem, I have to get out of my comfort zone.

During my time off I also want to start therapy to treat my problem and join Toastmasters to practice public speaking and communication skills. I also want to work on learning how to drive and getting my license. I know it's weird that I am 21 and still don't have a license. I put it off because of anxiety.

Before taking a break from school, I wanted to at least get an Associate's degree to have something to show for completing three years of college. I just decided to get an Associate of Arts degree. Nothing major, nothing specific just something. I just completed the last two classes I needed to earn the degree, and now I am looking for employment.

I told my brother I am thinking about getting a job in a restaurant starting off as a busser. He asked me, ""Why do you want to work in a restaurant and you have an Associate's degree?"" I told him, ""My degree is just a general degree. My plan was to take a break from school and find an entry-level job and work for a year or two. I've never had a job and I want to start at the bottom and get my feet wet. However, I wanted to at least have a degree than to not have one."" He said, ""But you are 21, you are not 16 anymore. I don't think you should be working as a busboy at your age."" I told him, ""Many people in their 20's work these kind of jobs.""

He also told me, ""With having an Associate's degree I think you can apply for better jobs than that. Don't sell yourself short.""
It's not selling myself short, it's starting from the bottom and working my way up. I also don't think it's wise to go into a career if you've never had a entry-level job.

I also want to treat my Social Anxiety problem, and I don't want to overwhelm myself with starting off with a socially demanding or big boy job.

I am applying for jobs near my area so I don't have a far commute because I don't drive.

I regret that I did not start doing these things in high school, but it's not too late. I'm still young, I'm only 21, and I still have time to turn my life around.

I spent a few days with my Brother and his son who is 7. I find it pretty stressy spending time with them, mainly because I feel like their personalities clash. My Brother is a glass-half-full extravert, always on the go, always putting a positive spin on things, famous for exaggerating the facts to make a positive story. My nephew is introverted and sensitive, with a tendency to episodes where he withdraws and, to my mind, is experiencing sadness. He may have such an episode 3 or 4 times in a day. Each time it might last 20 to 30 minutes, after which my nephew comes out of it somehow. This is very difficult for my brother to tolerate (which I can understand - it must be unbearable for a parent) but he tends to give my nephew a hard time about it, which I find uncomfortable because I don't think my nephew has any control over his sadness. Sometimes he becomes sad just at moments when 'enjoyment' or 'pleasure' is supposed to be happening - so parties, days out, holidays etc. I recognise this from my own personality. It's a trait that runs in my family, although my brother is not like this.

So my husband and I are classified as ""sub-fertile"" because there is a slight chance we could ever get pregnant naturally (its very small). We got pregnant with this baby (its our first and our only child) via IVF. We had to do IVF because of male factor infertility, I\'m all good. I\'ve not ever been on birth control after my mother and older sister both suffered blood clots and my mom had a massive pulmonary embolism from YAZ. Both my sister and I tested negative for the clotting disorder but she has continued getting blood clots even on blood thinners... so my trust in hormonal birth control is horrible. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny who, I was looking at getting on a copper IUD after this dude comes out but the side effects and risks are completely freaking me out. I don\'t want to go back to the pull out method (that was our only form of birth of birth control for 7 years. Thought we were just REALLY good at it. HAHAHA jokes on us). I can\'t emotionally handle possibly being pregnant or fretting over a late period because the possibility is there that it could happen. 18 months of infertility, never seeing a positive test and then subsequently IVF has somewhat traumatized me. I want all the risk avoided and complete control. I also don\'t want to be THAT couple people talk about that got pregnant naturally after successful IVF because being pregnant again is something I am against after this experience. I\'m okay and prefer having only one child.  The perk of IVF I guess is we have 7 embryos in storage that we could use if we were to ever change our minds, we could just thaw one out. No need for tubes. I also feel horrible and ungrateful about being so lucky and ending up with so many embryos and only using one because I know a lot of women would trade me in a heartbeat but this is for another discussion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question is: does anyone have any opinions or experience with having their tubes tide after delivering a baby?

So my husband and I are classified as &amp;quot;sub-fertile&amp;quot; because there is a slight chance we could ever get pregnant naturally (its very small). We got pregnant with this baby (its our first and our only child) via IVF. We had to do IVF because of male factor infertility, I&amp;#39;m all good. I&amp;#39;ve not ever been on birth control after my mother and older sister both suffered blood clots and my mom had a massive pulmonary embolism from YAZ. Both my sister and I tested negative for the clotting disorder but she has continued getting blood clots even on blood thinners... so my trust in hormonal birth control is horrible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any who, I was looking at getting on a copper IUD after this dude comes out but the side effects and risks are completely freaking me out. I don&amp;#39;t want to go back to the pull out method (that was our only form of birth of birth control for 7 years. Thought we were just REALLY good at it. HAHAHA jokes on us). I can&amp;#39;t emotionally handle possibly being pregnant or fretting over a late period because the possibility is there that it could happen. 18 months of infertility, never seeing a positive test and then subsequently IVF has somewhat traumatized me. I want all the risk avoided and complete control. I also don&amp;#39;t want to be THAT couple people talk about that got pregnant naturally after successful IVF because being pregnant again is something I am against after this experience. I&amp;#39;m okay and prefer having only one child.  The perk of IVF I guess is we have 7 embryos in storage that we could use if we were to ever change our minds, we could just thaw one out. No need for tubes. I also feel horrible and ungrateful about being so lucky and ending up with so many embryos and only using one because I know a lot of women would trade me in a heartbeat but this is for another discussion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is: does anyone have any opinions or experience with having their tubes tide after delivering a baby?

I ask this because I go through this question with my couple.

I am married, we had this talk several times, but our couple is so great that we never had the courage to split up, until this moment where we want to make the final decision before buying our first home ( we are 31 ).

Basically, she is 100% sure she wants one child. This is an important detail, only one child is in question.

Personally, I don't know. I have thought a lot, read and listened to a lot of testimonies from parents.

Yes, I am afraid. Afraid of feeling trapped because this is actually not the lifestyle I wanted. I have several passions, some hobbies, thus I need time for my couple, and for myself.

The last thing I want is to put an innocent being through a divorce. He or she never asked for this, never asked to be born.

This is not about money. I am not trading a child to buy a car or anything else, I have the chance to have a good income, and our current situation is quite ideal to welcome a child.

I understood not to focus too much on the baby phase, which I find very ... unpleasant from an external point of view.

Other than that, what really frightens me, is that I am not sensible or attracted by values such as education, knowledge transmission and so on. I also don't know if I really want to embrace all the responsibilities induced by having a child, whether he's young, a teenager or a young adult.

But she's really, really the love of my life. It may sounds cliché and silly, but if we have to divorce, man I'd rather end up alone. Yes, nobody is irreplaceable, but our couple is. This harmony and synergy between us is unique. And most important, I don't want anybody else.

I am deeply looking for parents which have one child and can give me some feedback on their parenting experiences. Am I completely overthinking, dramatising ?

Thank you !","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask this because I go through this question with my couple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am married, we had this talk several times, but our couple is so great that we never had the courage to split up, until this moment where we want to make the final decision before buying our first home ( we are 31 ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, she is 100% sure she wants one child. This is an important detail, only one child is in question.&lt;/p&gt;

This was WEEKS ago and I had no idea because I don’t get a lot of alone time with them, also it’s not anything I need to know. But apparently it’s been on both of their minds a LOT. Tonight they came to spend the night and we had some girl time. In the car the 10 yr old brought up the class and all of the things she learned. She had some questions about periods and wanted to confirm the names for some body parts (ex: uterus). All of this happened in front of the 9 yr old too and so she had some questions because she hadn’t gone through the class yet, she will next year. Her sister had already told her all about the class after it happened though so she had a rough idea of most things. I answered everything and explained that even though to them it’s a very awkward and uncomfortable topic it’s not a topic they should ever feel ashamed or awkward about, EVERY girl goes through it and it’s okay to ask questions about absolutely everything.

They both seemed absolutely relieved to open up about all this. I asked them if they talked to their mom or asked her questions about any of it and they said they feel too uncomfortable but they feel really comfortable with me and want to come to me in the future with questions. I of course said that’s fine, I’m ALWAYS here, but that their mom would love to be there for them too and that they don’t have to feel weird going to her because she would be very open with them.

They said they’d think about talking to her when they have questions but for now they want to just come to me, and if it’s okay “can you please not tell our mom we asked you or talked about this?” I said of course! Your secrets are always safe with me but this doesn’t have to be a secret because it’s nothing to be ashamed of!

Then we talked about ice cream and moved on.

My question: do I actually keep this a secret or do I let their mom know what was said? A part of me feels like I’m betraying their trust, but I’m also a mom and I know if my daughter was talking to her aunts about this stuff I’d want to know just so I could open the door for her to talk to me too. 
But if she opens that door suddenly they’re going to know I ratted and then might not open up in the future! Which I think is really important and I don’t want to hurt our bond.

Would I be wrong to keep their secret, keep their mom out of the loop and educate them when they ask? 

Or should I pretend to keep their secret but let their mom know they came to me? Maybe ask her not to let on that I said anything so they still trust me?

So first and foremost: Parental consent is something I will always support. I believe firmly in asking a parent's permission before playing with, speaking about subjects children don't bring up themselves (had a parent scream at me for asking their kid if they liked pokemon before), or friending a child on apps like pokemon go. I never ask for personal information and if a child gives me that information, I tell them not to give their information to strangers and decline. In my definition of children, I include individuals of 0-17 years.

I ask this question because my friend (30f), myself (22f), and her 5 yr old child went to the community center so he could play in the indoor play place there. The play place has a small play area at one end of the room and a row of chairs and tables along the other end. I was sitting at one of the tables with her and playing phone games when a child (maybe 14-15, didn't ask) sat down with us and started talking. His siblings were playing in the play place with my friend's child so she mostly watched him but added a few bits to the conversation. The kid said he was asked to take his siblings here but he gets bored as his phone was taken away. He asked to play on my phone, which I declined. He noticed my pokemon pin and we started to talk about pokemon. We shook hands, introduced ourselves, and talked pokemon for a bit. After about 15 minutes, his group left after he introduced me to his younger siblings (probably 10 and 5, by appearance). Very polite kid on all accounts who accepted my no with a simple no prob. My friend remarked that it was incredibly creepy and strange for me to talk to kids and that I should've just ignored him or told him not to talk to me because I was an adult. Is this a common belief? I honestly don't know, as I'm so used to being polite and exchanging pleasantries with everyone. I probably should've just said he shouldn't talk to strangers without his parent's approval and ignored him, I guess? With younger kids I practice this, but older kids (like 12 and up to me) I tend to not worry so much about a brief conversation they initiate. Is this wrong and how should I conduct myself in the future if it is? 

And one more question about boundaries: How should I establish boundaries with my godson (6m)? I know what I can and can't talk about with him, what he can play with, what he can't do anymore, etc...as his mother and I have talked about it at length. But, sometimes, he will come up to me and ""honk"" on my breasts or butt because he finds it funny and climb on me like a jungle gym. He will often lick my face and arm randomly, push his hands against my face, and headbutt my stomach. I have told him multiple times that the actions aren't okay and that he shouldn't do that to anybody. He usually understands for a few hours but he goes right back to it. I have talked to his mother about it and she's spoken to him as well. Should I just be more firm in my no or is there a particular way to go about getting him to stop this behavior? I don't encourage, smile, or laugh at the behavior as I was told to do by his mother, but it just doesn't seem to be enough.

Thanks for reading...I thought that I should ask parents their opinions on how people interact with children. I have no children of my own but have often been seen as a kind of caretaker by other adults because I was the oldest at daycare and took care of my younger brother and his friends. I worry about my interactions with children a lot because of my family life and really want to be a decent adult. I hope these questions aren't out of place here...Help, please?

But it seems he has a severe case of FOMO and won’t even lay down until everyone is in bed. If he knows someone is still up downstairs he wants to be down there. Which results in him not going to bed until 10pm or later. He has a full size bed so I lay in there with him and depending on his mood he will either stay with me or go into my room with my husband and sometimes flips back and forth for a while. We are both so exhausted at the end of the day that we physically can’t keep running up and down the stairs to keep him in his room. And he is a very strong willed, stubborn kid who’s excessive crying puts us over the edge. Most of the time he’s a great kid and awesome to be around but bedtime is seriously stressful. 

So when I get in bed with him at 10pm I almost always end up falling asleep for the night. Meaning my husband and I sleep in separate beds most nights, we get no alone time together at night and my 3yo is miserable because it’s late and he’s tired and then he’s hard to wake up for school the next day. 

We sleep trained him at 1 year old and it went great, he went to sleep on his own in his crib for about 6 months until he prematurely started climbing out of his crib. He did everything we could to keep him in there but he kept getting out so we opted for a bed earlier than anticipated. All hell broke loose when this happened. Because we felt he was too young to have free reign of the room and that’s when I started laying with him until he fell asleep. We are not prepared to go through sleep training again. which, if we followed the method we used previously, would entail making the room 100% toddler proof, buying and installing a new monitor and letting him cry it out in there. (Just a heads up, we’re not interested in anyone’s personal views on CIO at this time) Given his personality and how aware he is, it wouldn’t work, would probably only make things worse  and we just simply don’t have the heart to do it. So now here we are, tired and miserable.

So my son is 11 years old and he's a pretty smart kid (I'd say so if he wasn't; he's slated for advanced math next year lol). Some of the things he says makes me question if it's even something he should even know to be asking, and some of the shit is the usual stuff like ""where do babies come from"". He's also inherited a nice cocktail of defects from his mother and I:

ADD (Or *ADHD - Primarily Attentive* if you're nasty)  
Anxiety  
Maybe Depression

The first two for sure, but the last one it's hard to tell. I'm leaning towards no tho.

Anyways, here's the thing: I have a temper. A bad one. Silver lining though is it's really hard to start up, but once it does it'll go for a while or until I step away. There's also little things that will set me off if they remind me of a time that it happened before, as it's like I'm right back in it. It feels like I'm bragging. I can assure you I'm not. I hate being this way.

So on to my son. I love him to death. Best thing that ever happened to me. I want the absolute best for him. But there are times that I wonder if he's doing this shit on purpose just because. It's little things like IMMEDIATELY answering any question that is related to an event that happened more than 56 seconds ago with ""I don't know"". I perceive no effort, no thinking, and basically no actual attempt on his part. So I ask again. It usually goes something like this:

$me - What day was it that you played outside with the kids and held your breath underwater? (Literally within the last week)  
$son - I don't know  
$m - Well, was it last week?  
$s - I don't know!  
$m - Come on $son, try for me a little bit. Can you tell me if it was it at least before the weekend or was it after?  
$s - I don't know Dad!  
$m - Oh my God $son, take more than half of a second to think at the least. I want some kind of an answer. Was it last year?  
$s - Well no, it was closer than that.  
$m - SEE?! Now don't gimme that ""I don't know"" crap because if you didn't, you wouldn't have been able to tell me it was last year.

Then he proceeded to sit there and not eat because I told him to think and he is thinking. He said he couldn't multitask, i.e. - think and open the lid at the same time. Well, I guess he's gonna starve at that rate! *Sigh* There I go again. My bad.

Like I love the kid, but this shit just gets me. I know I'm older and wiser but I can't even wrap my brain around not even trying to answer something. It wasn't even like he was in trouble or anything. He left his wet clothes in a bag in the laundry room and I was just curious how long they were sitting there for is all.

He does this for other things in a similar way, with varying levels of importance. And also other unrelated things where I'm like ""Kid, wtf is going through your mind? You're making it harder on yourself right now...""

I have a bad memory too, but that started after... Unrelated Activities. I don't think it's genetic as no one in my family is that bad.

Am I being unreasonable?  
Is this something that all kids do?

Or

Should my kid not be so absent minded?  
Is he just putting me off just because?

There&amp;#39;s also little things that will set me off if they remind me of a time that it happened before, as it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m right back in it. It feels like I&amp;#39;m bragging. I can assure you I&amp;#39;m not. I hate being this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on to my son. I love him to death. Best thing that ever happened to me. I want the absolute best for him. But there are times that I wonder if he&amp;#39;s doing this shit on purpose just because. It&amp;#39;s little things like IMMEDIATELY answering any question that is related to an event that happened more than 56 seconds ago with &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know&amp;quot;. I perceive no effort, no thinking, and basically no actual attempt on his part. So I ask again. It usually goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$me - What day was it that you played outside with the kids and held your breath underwater? (Literally within the last week)&lt;br/&gt;
$son - I don&amp;#39;t know&lt;br/&gt;
$m - Well, was it last week?&lt;br/&gt;
$s - I don&amp;#39;t know!&lt;br/&gt;
$m - Come on $son, try for me a little bit. Can you tell me if it was it at least before the weekend or was it after?&lt;br/&gt;
$s - I don&amp;#39;t know Dad!&lt;br/&gt;
$m - Oh my God $son, take more than half of a second to think at the least. I want some kind of an answer. Was it last year?&lt;br/&gt;
$s - Well no, it was closer than that.&lt;br/&gt;
$m - SEE?! Now don&amp;#39;t gimme that &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know&amp;quot; crap because if you didn&amp;#39;t, you wouldn&amp;#39;t have been able to tell me it was last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he proceeded to sit there and not eat because I told him to think and he is thinking. He said he couldn&amp;#39;t multitask, i.e. - think and open the lid at the same time. Well, I guess he&amp;#39;s gonna starve at that rate! &lt;em&gt;Sigh&lt;/em&gt; There I go again. My bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I love the kid, but this shit just gets me. I know I&amp;#39;m older and wiser but I can&amp;#39;t even wrap my brain around not even trying to answer something. It wasn&amp;#39;t even like he was in trouble or anything. He left his wet clothes in a bag in the laundry room and I was just curious how long they were sitting there for is all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He does this for other things in a similar way, with varying levels of importance. And also other unrelated things where I&amp;#39;m like &amp;quot;Kid, wtf is going through your mind? You&amp;#39;re making it harder on yourself right now...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a bad memory too, but that started after... Unrelated Activities. I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s genetic as no one in my family is that bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I being unreasonable?&lt;br/&gt;
Is this something that all kids do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should my kid not be so absent minded?&lt;br/&gt;
Is he just putting me off just because?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Formatting - because Reddit doesn&amp;#39;t seem to think line breaks are what they are.&lt;/p&gt;

This will probably be a long post, thank you everyone who will take their time and give me advise through my family's situation. A few things to summarize off the bat:

1. Brother is turning 17 years old, a junior in highschool
2. Have two parents at home. However, our family have never been the happiest nor loving throughout his childhood
3. I am his older brother almost 2X his age, and I live overseas, hence I can't not physically do much

This has to do with my younger brother. Ever since he was young he has always avoided responsibility, lack self-pride (esteem), socially awkward and naive about reality. All of this is fine provided he go to school and eventually mature to go on to have a life of his own. However, my family is now worried and overly stressed about his recent developments. His above mention characteristics have progressively worsened. Since February this year, he has been skipping school due to sleep.He stay up late at night playing video games. Homework and projects are non-existent. He has told my parents he realize he is a failure and accepts that. I'm unsure if he truly realizes what that means... He spend most of his time at home playing games or sleeping. Recently, we enrolled him in therapy where they diagnosed him with slight depression and social anxiety. He has since been taking medication. However, according to my parents there is little or no change. He lacks understanding of his future / reality....  At the same time he is an extremely brilliant kid. Example being he scored a 1500/1600 on the SAT this year without studying, but he has a 55 average! 

In addition to therapy, we have taken other preventive and supportive measures to help him get better such as: 

1. Take away his gaming and computer---- Result in him just sitting in his bedroom doing absolutely nothing for hours or on his cell phone watching Youtube
2. Encourage him to find a passion / hobby-- He has none, I've tried programming, robotic, sports, anything he wish just to get him out there but he refuses or gives up after a day or two. I got him a job through a friend for him to work in a restaurant once a week. He does go to work but keeps to himself most of the time and spend the money on games. 
3. Force him to go to school / punish him if he doesn't...---- That's the hard part, my parents are first gen immigrants and had him when they are relatively older. Due to our family past, my parents have martial issues which probably contributed to a loveless household--&gt; his emotional state now. In my opinion, my mother was and is still an enabler of his actions ever since he was young. She has since slowly woken up and realize her past actions and even stated to him if no change occurs by 18 he is out on his own. Due to myself being overseas I can only support them through appointments and checkups. My brother refuse to communicate to me ( either disappointed in himself, or doesn't want me to nag him), we have not communicated for over an year ever since I moved sea. I have made it very clear to him that I will always be there to support him if he ever reach out to me for help, but I will never spoon feed him. 

Understanding a lot of past actions from both my parents and me could've contributed to his current state. I am seeking advice on anyone that are aware or dealt with similar situations. How can we encourage him if he refuse to change himself? If he doesn't change by 18, what should be our next plan of action... I speak for myself stating that once again I will be there when he is WILLING to change, but I will never spoon-feed him. Ever since his mental diagnosis, he has been justifying his action further by utilizing his failure in life due to mental health issues.

I am honestly at a loss here. I do not know what to know anymore, my mother is overly stressed and cry every time we talk about his status. I hate to see his life go to waste especially with such a young promising mind..... Any advice that I might not have thought of would be much appreciated. Thank you","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will probably be a long post, thank you everyone who will take their time and give me advise through my family&amp;#39;s situation. A few things to summarize off the bat:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brother is turning 17 years old, a junior in highschool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have two parents at home. However, our family have never been the happiest nor loving throughout his childhood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am his older brother almost 2X his age, and I live overseas, hence I can&amp;#39;t not physically do much&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has to do with my younger brother. Ever since he was young he has always avoided responsibility, lack self-pride (esteem), socially awkward and naive about reality. All of this is fine provided he go to school and eventually mature to go on to have a life of his own. However, my family is now worried and overly stressed about his recent developments. His above mention characteristics have progressively worsened. Since February this year, he has been skipping school due to sleep.He stay up late at night playing video games. Homework and projects are non-existent. He has told my parents he realize he is a failure and accepts that. I&amp;#39;m unsure if he truly realizes what that means... He spend most of his time at home playing games or sleeping. Recently, we enrolled him in therapy where they diagnosed him with slight depression and social anxiety. He has since been taking medication. However, according to my parents there is little or no change. He lacks understanding of his future / reality....  At the same time he is an extremely brilliant kid. Example being he scored a 1500/1600 on the SAT this year without studying, but he has a 55 average! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to therapy, we have taken other preventive and supportive measures to help him get better such as: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take away his gaming and computer---- Result in him just sitting in his bedroom doing absolutely nothing for hours or on his cell phone watching Youtube&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage him to find a passion / hobby-- He has none, I&amp;#39;ve tried programming, robotic, sports, anything he wish just to get him out there but he refuses or gives up after a day or two. I got him a job through a friend for him to work in a restaurant once a week. He does go to work but keeps to himself most of the time and spend the money on games. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Force him to go to school / punish him if he doesn&amp;#39;t...---- That&amp;#39;s the hard part, my parents are first gen immigrants and had him when they are relatively older. Due to our family past, my parents have martial issues which probably contributed to a loveless household--&amp;gt; his emotional state now. In my opinion, my mother was and is still an enabler of his actions ever since he was young. She has since slowly woken up and realize her past actions and even stated to him if no change occurs by 18 he is out on his own. Due to myself being overseas I can only support them through appointments and checkups. My brother refuse to communicate to me ( either disappointed in himself, or doesn&amp;#39;t want me to nag him), we have not communicated for over an year ever since I moved sea. I have made it very clear to him that I will always be there to support him if he ever reach out to me for help, but I will never spoon feed him. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding a lot of past actions from both my parents and me could&amp;#39;ve contributed to his current state. I am seeking advice on anyone that are aware or dealt with similar situations. How can we encourage him if he refuse to change himself? If he doesn&amp;#39;t change by 18, what should be our next plan of action... I speak for myself stating that once again I will be there when he is WILLING to change, but I will never spoon-feed him. Ever since his mental diagnosis, he has been justifying his action further by utilizing his failure in life due to mental health issues. In all honesty, I feel like he has never ever taken responsibility for anything in his life and once again using this as an escape mechanism. How should we deal with his mental health issues if he refuse to make positive change? &lt;/p&gt;

My daughter has slept through the night since she was like 7 or 8 months old. She normally sleeps from 8pm-630 or 7am. She takes one to two naps during the day usually about 2 hours at a time. So she’s an amazing sleeper most of the time. 

For the past 2 or 3 weeks she has had 1 night a week she’s not sleeping through the night. Tonight is that night and I’m wondering if there’s something going on. Like could it be a phase? Is she getting sick? Teething maybe? 

An example of a night like tonight is that she will go to bed at 8 like usual. Then around 12 she will wake up and whine. She doesn’t cry just whines. I’ll go in and change her diaper and give her a fresh sippy cup of water (she had to have a sippy of water to sleep for the night and for her naps. She doesn’t normally drink much she just has to have it). Then I will lay down and if she whines more I go in and check on her diaper and put her back to bed. Normally she will go back to sleep around 30-45 minutes later. Then she wakes up around 2 and we repeat the above. Then she will wake up at her usual time and acts completely normal the next day.   And the rest of the week she acts normal. This only happens once a week every time. 

So, has anyone else experienced this? Any clue as to what could be happening these night? I just got up with her twice in one hour.

So my son is 23 and lives at home. He’s doesn’t pay rent because he’s currently unemployed but he does go to school full time and is a theater student so his father and I don’t want him to drive himself crazy. He’s generally a good kid, sometimes he and his father butt heads but other than that he helps out.

My son has been dating his boyfriend for about 4 months, he’s 26, has a good job, is very sweet and is good for my son. We really like him. Although my husband and I started arguing about a policy we have.

We are Christian parents but some of our children (2, perhaps 3 out of 4) aren’t Christian themselves. We fully accept my son as a gay man and are happy that he is happy but sex before marriage in our house is a line we had with the kids for a while. In order to enforce this, we didn’t allow any of our kids to sleep in the same bed in their rooms with their SO. They could however sleep on the couch in the living room together.

Granted, the rule was made when they were in high school and when we had a nice section for their guests to sleep on to avoid staying in the same bed.

Our son and his bf (the bf unknowingly so) have broken this rule 3 times. We don’t know that they had sex but we suspect it. However we’ve been able to see that my son and his bf have slept in the same bed together when he has come over. 

My husband and I have argued over this. I’m in favor of abolishing the rule as our son is an adult and does very well in school and constantly impresses is with his performances. Where he is a much more strict “our house our rules” type approach.

I should also say that my son has somewhat of a makeshift room, he initially went to a Christian school out of state, but after coming out and leaving religion they treated him very badly. However in our 3 bedroom home, we have his old room to his younger sister when he moved out. To compensate we put up a partition and a small gate to keep the dogs out in the play room. We can’t see into his room from the living room, but we can if we try to enter the garage.

His bf also currently lives at home with much stricter parents, I’m not sure why this is, but I can suspect it’s just to save money, my sons bf seems to be very frugal and smart with his money. Although I know he and my have talked about eventually moving to a nearby city after this upcoming semester.

This might be the wrong forum, but I think it will help to see this from a parent’s point of view.

So, I’m currently doing a summer internship with my sibling. We are staying by ourselves for the internship. Our mom comes and visits us. We have an uncle who lives about an hour away and he invites her to come to a friend’s wedding. Since she wasn’t prepared for such an event, she has my sibling go through her(mom’s) luggage and finds a nice dress. My sister and I were napping. When I woke up, my mom tells me to iron her dress, and she also lets me know that it’s delicate. Because of that, I set up the ironing station, and I plug the iron in last so that it is relatively cold. The moment I touch the iron to the dress, I feel something sticky, so I immediately pull the iron away, but too late, the cloth has been burned. I looked at my mom and say that I probably shouldn’t be ironing this dressed it burned. She immediately flips out on me(which is totally understandable because I had just burned her dress). She immediately starts saying I spoiled her entire trip to visit us, and she shouldn’t have come. She continues to say what bad luck I’ve done to her and how someone of her caliber shouldn’t be wearing such burned clothe. She goes on to say she can’t believe she’ll be spending thousands of dollars on my college tuition and I’m destroying her property. She then says I probably did so intentionally(I had so clue that this dress was going to burned. I have a feeling such clothes shouldn’t be ironed.). I tried to touch the clothe to see how burned it was and she only flipped out even more saying I shouldn’t even touch it. My head hurts right now. She goes on and on. She rants about who sent me her way that day. I understand that she’s mad because I burned her clothes, but I think she went a little too far.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might be the wrong forum, but I think it will help to see this from a parent’s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

When we get back I'm upset. All my mom has to say about me is that I'm a bitch. So yeah I'm upset and bitchy. I decided maybe I should sit outside for a bit and calm down since everyone went inside already

Me and my wife live in my country(Brazil) and often go to her country(Zimbabwe) for her to stay with her kids.

There dad left them so I'm the one who introduced to them all kinds of stuff including video-games, tabs, board games, sports...

I also do a lot for them, like spending a lot of money buying them western things like computer, internet, phones(Those things are a luxury here), play with them the whole day, etc. They miss me too much when I'm not there.

Today I just lashed out. I was helping the 6 year's old boy to play a game in my macbook then I asked his brother(13) to play with us. He didn't like the ideia because he fights a lot with that brother and he decided to press the button to turn of my computer, that takes ages to turn it on again. I just couldn't, I screamed ""why did u do that?"", push him agressively(didn't hit him, just push him) and went back to the hotel, in rage.

Of course I shouldn't have done that, I was in rage. Now I'm alone at the hotel, very ashamed and very afraid that I have hurted my relationship with them. While he was around, their dad was very abusive and violent and I really fear that what I did reminded them of that. I don't know what to do, if I should come back. If yes, what should I say... It's complicated.

I really need some advise, specially from moms that are married or dating someone who is not the father. Thank u","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will make it short, thank so much for the space&lt;/p&gt;

He didn&amp;#39;t like the ideia because he fights a lot with that brother and he decided to press the button to turn of my computer, that takes ages to turn it on again. I just couldn&amp;#39;t, I screamed &amp;quot;why did u do that?&amp;quot;, push him agressively(didn&amp;#39;t hit him, just push him) and went back to the hotel, in rage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I shouldn&amp;#39;t have done that, I was in rage. Now I&amp;#39;m alone at the hotel, very ashamed and very afraid that I have hurted my relationship with them. While he was around, their dad was very abusive and violent and I really fear that what I did reminded them of that. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do, if I should come back. If yes, what should I say... It&amp;#39;s complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really need some advise, specially from moms that are married or dating someone who is not the father. Thank u&lt;/p&gt;

Hey folks, I'm a 20y/o boy that's planning to get a tattoo. I'm a Singaporean thats currently in the SF for internship.

I have the design and placement all sorted out and I have already thought about the consequences or rather things i would have to face. The tattoo would be a snake piece that can be hidden within the length of my shorts. I know it defeats the purpose sort of, of having a tattoo to let others view it but I am doing it because i like the design myself.

I have already thought about how it may affect my future and I feel like it wouldn't affect my profession in any way.

The main issue i am facing with is my mother, she's really kind hearted and has been a loving mother and someone I really hate disappointing. I've worked and studied hard in school to get achievements to make my parents proud because she always believed in my potential and she's my role model and motivation to be a successful man.

To cut the story short, she is the last person in the world i would want to disappoint but I have thought about getting a tattoo done for really long even though I am only 20. I tested water by sending her a picture making her think that I have already got it tatted. Had a nice long conversation with her and we both kind of cried over the phone, and she felt that since it's reversible, she just has to accept what it is and that i would just have to take better care of myself thereafter.

I just felt really guilty for the disappointment I have led, I have 2 months to rethink about it before my tattoo appointment and i would like to ask you guys to give me advice on whether I should go ahead with it?

I am really confused and lost because I can finally go ahead and tattoo knowing it wont be a surprise but will she eventually be fine with looking at the tattoo when I'm back in Singapore? Or would I have the guilt

p.s. Her concerns are not about opinions others would have or whether I will become a bad kid. She has her believes that god gave us the opportunity of life and parents gave you the body, that i should treasure and not deal any ""harm"" in this case tattooing.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey folks, I&amp;#39;m a 20y/o boy that&amp;#39;s planning to get a tattoo.

I'm 17 years old and have been driving for about a year now. My grandpa recently bought a car for me after hearing my divorced parents bickering too much about me getting a car (even though my mom said no, but now shes accepting the fact that my grandpa bought the car.)

The car is a used 2006 Acura MDX (basically a fancier honda pilot since Acura is made by Honda) with 4 wheel drive and v6 it has the max trim level with about 140k miles on it with no damage visible ( only some scratches and no dents) for $4000.

The car has a lot of features a backup camera, navigation, Bluetooth, post-collision ( not the same as pre-collision. Basically, this system reduces the speed of the car and when the accident happens the damage is not as bad as it would be), and a DVD player for the back seat.

I was really starting to like that car, but then my mom said that I will not drive that car and she will drive it.

She wants me to drive her 2010 Toyota rav4 with about 195k miles (new when my mom got it) ( it's basic trim level nothing fancy and the first car I mainly drove. The first car I learned to drive with is my dads 2006 Lexus RX).

it has Bluetooth through an aux port ( which I added on), but overall not a lot of features, just a basic car with a radio and other things (unless I want to buy 3rd party stuff for the car). The car has two visible damages (dents) one in the front and one in the back ( this was caused by me when I was driving it. I'm still new at driving, but learning.)

I'm not saying the rav4 is bad or anything. I'm just grateful that I have a car now with some exceptions which I understand (I'll be paying some stuff for the car like maybe gas or insurance and I can't drive too far. My mom doesn't know yet.) Sorry if I keep on getting sidetracked. Here is my problem. Before I didn't care that I was getting my mom's Rav4 because I've been driving it for a year now with her (before my grandpa getting the car we have just been sharing the rav4) and I love the car too. However, the more I keep thinking about it, shouldn't I get the car my grandpa gave to me as a gift (sorry if it sounds like I'm getting spoiled, but that thought just won't go away)? I understand my mom's point when she said I'll be getting the rav4 because the rav4 have damages caused by me and it's better to have the first car where it's not too fancy and a bit beat up (Sorry again I forgot to mention this will be my first car too). Again, I love both of the SUV/cars, even though both cars have their pros and cons.

Toyota Rav4

Pro: Good mpg ( advertising 24 mpg combined, 22 mpg city and 28 highway. I'm averaging around 21.7), don't have to worry about damaging it that much because I kinda already damaged it, and I think it's a good size car too. also, the car was brand new when my mom got it, so we know the history of the car. Also, I'm used to the car.

con: nothing that I can think of except that it's so basic, lots of miles, and a hand me down ( sorry if I sound spoiled just thinking of cons for the car)

Acura MDX

pro: luxury car brand, lots of features (see list), fits up to 7 people, leather seats, and no visible damage

con: When got the car some repairs had to be done (don't want to go into too much because I'm writing so much and don't want to be sidetracked, but if you want to know I'll put them in the comments later,) but who knows if the problem will come back or something bad will happen (the car was bought from a small dealership, so unknown history.) Also, the mpg (advertised as 17 MPG combined, 15 city, and 21 highway) on this car is very bad and requires premium gas instead of regular unleaded, the A/C positioners don't move (but I am getting the car fix though), and It's also a luxury brand, so it's probably going to be a bit more expensive to maintain (however, Lexus is a luxury brand and their parts are cheap and not too expensive to maintain, so I don't know) , and I think that's it (feels like I'm forgetting something.)

What is common about both cars

I like both of them, both have a cold A/C , both are dependable car/ brand, both are SUV, has safety standards already ( airbag, electronic stability control, and anti-lock breaks which I wanted already), and they handle really well.

The main point of this do you think my mom is right about the car thing and I should drive the rav4 instead of the car my grandpa wants to give me? Thank you really much if you are reading far because I did type a lot, was a bit off point and I wanted some opinions (also to vent too because I do not know I feel about this.)

We said we were open to all ages, and lo and behold in the interest of keeping a family together an entire family was placed with us. 

Right away the dynamic was pretty obvious. The 15-year-old is the oldest (different father), and basically the Dad of the family. The next oldest is 9, and there's also two 7 year olds and a four year old. For the first couple days they would look to him first but have gradually acclimatized 

The oldest is the one I worry about. His teachers say he doesn't talk to anyone at school, he lashes out, he sits alone, and at home he just stays in his room unless he's playing with one of the kids. The times he's playing with the kids seem like the only time he smiles at all- every other time his face is either blank or guarded. 

There are just a couple of things that really worry me- he eats like a convict, always covering his food like he expects someone to steal it. I've found just random snack items in his room before, to the point where I just asked him straight-up if he'd like to use one of the plastic storage drawers we have for his own personal stash. About a week in I went to wake him up because he forgot to set his alarm for school and the moment I even touch his arm he bolts *straight up* and I have to dodge a fist and he looks around, scared out of his mind. I'm not even sure in those few seconds he was aware of where he was. I'm not sure I want to know what happened that *that* is his reaction. I've never seen him sleep through the night all the way, and whenever I'm up very early (I work 4 AM-noon Sunday to Thursday) I'll hear him tossing and turning and moaning in his sleep. He also recoils like he was shocked whenever one of us make any kind of physical contact. 

I've tried to approach him, and just let him know he can talk about anything he needs to if he wants, but every time he just ignore me or lashes out. His usual line is that he ""doesn't need a couple of faggots telling him to talk about his feelings."" I'm not even sure if I should bother bringing up therapy with the social worker because I know what his reaction is gonna be (I'm just not gonna repeat the things he called the social worker).

His usual line is that he &amp;quot;doesn&amp;#39;t need a couple of faggots telling him to talk about his feelings.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m not even sure if I should bother bringing up therapy with the social worker because I know what his reaction is gonna be (I&amp;#39;m just not gonna repeat the things he called the social worker). &lt;/p&gt;

**TLDR: I try to get my sisters out of the house (I drove from an hour away) but [11F], who is emotionally abused is too upset to go anywhere now. I'm frustrated. I want to help but she wont let me.**

I have two younger sisters [11F] and [9F] who still live with my mom [50F] and dad [51M]. I moved out as soon as I turned 18 because my mental health was deteriorating from the constant yelling (not necessarily at me, just everyone yelling at everyone).

Younger sister [11F] takes so much crap from my parents. My mom tells me constantly what a problem she is, how she's always in a bad mood, how she understands why sister doesn't have any friends, etc. My mom and dad do this thing where they'll try to make her upset, and then punish her for being upset. Sister closes herself off of course, and is constantly in a bad mood. I cant remember the last time she went a whole day in a good/neutral mood.

I try to be there for her. I try to be there for both of them, but mostly [11F] because other sister [9F] doesn't really take any crap from my parents. In my parents eyes [9F] is a good kid, while [11F] is the problem child. I try to text with [11F] , ask her about her day. We play games with eachother online. I also try to visit my sisters at least 2 times a week, but I live an hour away so it's expensive to spend that much in gas.

Well, I was talking with [11F] and she expressed interest in the summer reading program at their local library. She also kept asking when I would come over, so I could register them for the program at the library. I called in to work today so I could go see them.. and [11F] is in a bad mood. She no longer wants to go. She wont even say hi to me. I'm beyond frustrated. It's taking everything in me not to scream at her (I wont do it because I know it wont achieve anything).

I'm divorced from my ex due to domestic violence. My ex is prone to aggressive behaviour even in front of our son and despite the protection order. He has  breeched the order many times, two of which I had no other choice but to report. I had a settlement agreement the first time around only asking that he refrain from the verbal and emotional abuse and to behave appropriately in front of our child. The second time I refused a settlement, he pleaded guilty and was criminally charged. He's a very difficult person and fights me every step of the way. I'm telling you all this to give you an idea of the hostility and dysfunction we're faced with. 

I'm in and out of meetings with social workers and we get no where. The social workers also seem to treat our case as anyone else's and say he may not be abusive to our child. Our son has a hard time going on day visits. Some days crying and hiding under his bed. It takes some convincing to get him to go but he's usually very unhappy. This has been going on for a long time but more so since about age 3 and from there gets progressively worse. Some days I can get him to go without a fuss by allowing him some game time afterwards. He's also a very shy kid who takes a while to warm up to others. My ex has been seeing someone else and I think they're living together. I'm not sure if they are married or not. That's how non existent the communication is. I email him about things regarding our child when I have to but get no response and he's not interested in resolving issues. For instance,  he reacts with anger when he sees that our son is resistant to going on these visits. Abusive personality or not,  I'm sure it's difficult for any parent to witness their child not wanting to go with them. I asked him to be understanding and patient with our son but he continually just accuses me of brainwashing our son and saying that I don't discipline him. 

He's style of parenting is very military like and he's ego is extra bruised to the point he cannot think like a parent should. I know how bad that sounds but it's true.  It's always got to be about him having the final say and he can't stand anyone opposing / questioning / disliking him in any way. He can easily terrify anyone into getting his way and I can see how intimidated my child is. It's also important to note that the parenting plan was made an order of court and was done so when my son was only about 18 months old. My ex's circumstances were also different at the time i.e not living with someone else and her kids. He also gave me a fake address at a meeting we had in front of social workers.    I don't know where he lives or what his living situation is like and yet I'm supposed to send our son for overnights. I asked the social worker about it but she didn't seem too concerned but said she will make a call to someone and will get back to me. At the time of constructing the initial parenting plan we couldn't agree on a lot. He was asking for overnights at a too young age and making some other really ridiculous demands so we got stuck with a recommendation which I think for the most part did take into consideration the risks in our case during the first couple of years. 

How do I help my son manage his emotions and the anxiety I know is going to come along with overnights? How did you help/ convince your child to go if he or she refused and teared up? Keep in mind I don't have the support from his father when it comes to moments like this. What do I do if my son isn't coping? How long should I wait to see if he'll adjust? How can I get him to open up more about his fears and anxieties ? How do I cope knowing my son is not going to cope? He still refuses to sleep away from me and even when with family members that he's super close to,  asks for me within at least a couple of hours.

I think if his father and I had at least a somewhat functional friendship and he did not have an abusive personality I could handle this much better but I'm not sure he'd even call me if our son was not coping at all. Thank you for reading and advising. Please excuse any typos and if it turns out I that I have left out any important information.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,  &lt;/p&gt;

I shrugged my concern off when I remembered that she lives in a [same state] different county and their schools most likely a different curriculum.

She even handed me a leap frog level one reading book and she couldn't read a single word.

I moved back with my parents as they're getting old.

I used to get hit quite often by my parents (At least once a week) until I was 15, and although it didn't affect me in my early 20s, after getting depressed, it's making me realize how it has affected my self-worth.

I feel grateful that they've given me the freedom to choose my career (which most Indian parents don't allow), but sometimes it is just gets difficult.

I don't want to move out of the house because I need to take care of them as they're getting older. 

So, how should I learn to manage this whole situation.

Originally, I’d planned on surprising her with a trip to Build-A-Bear and letting her stuff/clothe a furry friend of her choosing. I thought it would be nice to give her both a gift and a memory for her birthday to make it extra special. Thing is, Build-A-Bear is ridiculously expensive and doesn’t really offer many accessories to actually play with. I still think she’d enjoy picking and stuffing a bear—a part of me just worries that it would get added to her (somewhat loved) pile of stuffed animals.

With that in mind, I was thinking about maybe getting her an American Girl Wellie Wisher instead of going to Build-A-Bear. She hasn’t really gotten into bigger dolls yet, but she enjoys imaginative play with her Hatchimals Colleggtibles and her L.O.L. dolls. American Girl offers a lot more as far as accessories go. I’ve also read that the Wellie Wishers are accompanied by books suitable for her age, which I think would keep her more engaged with the doll. 

Thing is, American Girl is even MORE expensive than Build-A-Bear, so I’d most likely have to get the doll second hand. AKA, there wouldn’t be a super special surprise birthday trip to the American Girl store like there would be with Build-A-Bear. 

Another option I considered was an Our Generation doll, but I don’t know. I like the story component of the Wellie Wisher if we’re going that route. Ugh. This is long. 

Basically, I’m conflicted and would really appreciate some guidance from you beautiful, wise humans. So, Wellie Wishers or Build-A-Bear? Or an Our Generation doll? 

(Also, if you think going with the Wellie Wisher is my best bet, do you know where I could get a good deal on one?)
